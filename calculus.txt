PROLOGUE.
Considering how many fools can calculate, it is surprising that it
should be thought either a difficult or a tedious task for any other fool
to learn how to master the same tricks.
Some calculus-tricks are quite easy. Some are enormously difficult.
The fools who write the textbooks of advanced mathematics—and they
are mostly clever fools—seldom take the trouble to show you how easy
the easy calculations are. On the contrary, they seem to desire to
impress you with their tremendous cleverness by going about it in the
most difficult way.
Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have had to unteach
myself the difficulties, and now beg to present to my fellow fools the
parts that are not hard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest will
follow. What one fool can do, another can.
CHAPTER I.
TO DELIVER YOU FROM THE PRELIMINARY
TERRORS.
The preliminary terror, which chokes off most fifth-form boys from
even attempting to learn how to calculate, can be abolished once for
all by simply stating what is the meaning—in common-sense terms—of
the two principal symbols that are used in calculating.
These dreadful symbols are:
(1) d which merely means “a little bit of.”
Thus dx means a little bit of x; or du means a little bit of u. Ordinary
mathematicians think it more polite to say “an element of,”
instead of “a little bit of.” Just as you please. But you will find that
these little bits (or elements) may be considered to be indefinitely small.
(2) Z
which is merely a long S, and may be called (if you like) “the
sum of.”
Thus Z
dx means the sum of all the little bits of x; or Z
dt means
the sum of all the little bits of t. Ordinary mathematicians call this
symbol “the integral of.” Now any fool can see that if x is considered
as made up of a lot of little bits, each of which is called dx, if you
add them all up together you get the sum of all the dx’s, (which is the
CALCULUS MADE EASY 2
same thing as the whole of x). The word “integral” simply means “the
whole.” If you think of the duration of time for one hour, you may (if
you like) think of it as cut up into 3600 little bits called seconds. The
whole of the 3600 little bits added up together make one hour.
When you see an expression that begins with this terrifying symbol,
you will henceforth know that it is put there merely to give you
instructions that you are now to perform the operation (if you can) of
totalling up all the little bits that are indicated by the symbols that
follow.
That’s all.
CHAPTER II.
ON DIFFERENT DEGREES OF SMALLNESS.
We shall find that in our processes of calculation we have to deal with
small quantities of various degrees of smallness.
We shall have also to learn under what circumstances we may consider
small quantities to be so minute that we may omit them from
consideration. Everything depends upon relative minuteness.
Before we fix any rules let us think of some familiar cases. There
are 60 minutes in the hour, 24 hours in the day, 7 days in the week.
There are therefore 1440 minutes in the day and 10080 minutes in the
week.
Obviously 1 minute is a very small quantity of time compared with
a whole week. Indeed, our forefathers considered it small as compared
with an hour, and called it “one min`ute,” meaning a minute
fraction—namely one sixtieth—of an hour. When they came to require
still smaller subdivisions of time, they divided each minute into
60 still smaller parts, which, in Queen Elizabeth’s days, they called
“second min`utes” (i.e. small quantities of the second order of minuteness).
Nowadays we call these small quantities of the second order of
smallness “seconds.” But few people know why they are so called.
Now if one minute is so small as compared with a whole day, how
CALCULUS MADE EASY 4
much smaller by comparison is one second!
Again, think of a farthing as compared with a sovereign: it is barely
worth more than 1
1000 part. A farthing more or less is of precious little
importance compared with a sovereign: it may certainly be regarded
as a small quantity. But compare a farthing with £1000: relatively to
this greater sum, the farthing is of no more importance than 1
1000 of a
farthing would be to a sovereign. Even a golden sovereign is relatively
a negligible quantity in the wealth of a millionaire.
Now if we fix upon any numerical fraction as constituting the proportion
which for any purpose we call relatively small, we can easily
state other fractions of a higher degree of smallness. Thus if, for the
purpose of time, 1
60 be called a small fraction, then 1
60 of 1
60 (being a
small fraction of a small fraction) may be regarded as a small quantity
of the second order of smallness.∗
Or, if for any purpose we were to take 1 per cent. (i.e. 1
100 ) as a
small fraction, then 1 per cent. of 1 per cent. (i.e. 1
10,000 ) would be a
small fraction of the second order of smallness; and 1
1,000,000 would be
a small fraction of the third order of smallness, being 1 per cent. of
1 per cent. of 1 per cent.
Lastly, suppose that for some very precise purpose we should regard
1
1,000,000 as “small.” Thus, if a first-rate chronometer is not to lose
or gain more than half a minute in a year, it must keep time with
an accuracy of 1 part in 1, 051, 200. Now if, for such a purpose, we
∗The mathematicians talk about the second order of “magnitude” (i.e. greatness)
when they really mean second order of smallness. This is very confusing to
beginners.
DIFFERENT DEGREES OF SMALLNESS 5
regard 1
1,000,000 (or one millionth) as a small quantity, then 1
1,000,000 of
1
1,000,000 , that is 1
1,000,000,000,000 (or one billionth) will be a small quantity
of the second order of smallness, and may be utterly disregarded, by
comparison.
Then we see that the smaller a small quantity itself is, the more
negligible does the corresponding small quantity of the second order
become. Hence we know that in all cases we are justified in neglecting
the small quantities of the second—or third (or higher)—orders, if only
we take the small quantity of the first order small enough in itself.
But, it must be remembered, that small quantities if they occur in
our expressions as factors multiplied by some other factor, may become
important if the other factor is itself large. Even a farthing becomes
important if only it is multiplied by a few hundred.
Now in the calculus we write dx for a little bit of x. These things
such as dx, and du, and dy, are called “differentials,” the differential
of x, or of u, or of y, as the case may be. [You read them as dee-eks,
or dee-you, or dee-wy.] If dx be a small bit of x, and relatively small of
itself, it does not follow that such quantities as x · dx, or x
2 dx, or a
x dx
are negligible. But dx × dx would be negligible, being a small quantity
of the second order.
A very simple example will serve as illustration.
Let us think of x as a quantity that can grow by a small amount so
as to become x+dx, where dx is the small increment added by growth.
The square of this is x
2 + 2x · dx + (dx)
2
. The second term is not
negligible because it is a first-order quantity; while the third term is of
the second order of smallness, being a bit of, a bit of x
2
. Thus if we
CALCULUS MADE EASY 6
took dx to mean numerically, say, 1
60 of x, then the second term would
be 2
60 of x
2
, whereas the third term would be 1
3600 of x
2
. This last term
is clearly less important than the second. But if we go further and take
dx to mean only 1
1000 of x, then the second term will be 2
1000 of x
2
, while
the third term will be only 1
1,000,000 of x
2
.
x
x
Fig. 1.
Geometrically this may be depicted as follows: Draw a square
(Fig. 1) the side of which we will take to represent x. Now suppose
the square to grow by having a bit dx added to its size each way.
The enlarged square is made up of the original square x
2
, the two
rectangles at the top and on the right, each of which is of area x · dx
(or together 2x · dx), and the little square at the top right-hand corner
which is (dx)
2
. In Fig. 2 we have taken dx as quite a big fraction
of x—about 1
5
. But suppose we had taken it only 1
100—about the
thickness of an inked line drawn with a fine pen. Then the little corner
square will have an area of only 1
10,000 of x
2
, and be practically invisible.
Clearly (dx)
2
is negligible if only we consider the increment dx to be
itself small enough.
Let us consider a simile.

Suppose a millionaire were to say to his secretary: next week I will
give you a small fraction of any money that comes in to me. Suppose
that the secretary were to say to his boy: I will give you a small fraction
of what I get. Suppose the fraction in each case to be 1
100 part. Now
if Mr. Millionaire received during the next week £1000, the secretary
would receive £10 and the boy 2 shillings. Ten pounds would be a
small quantity compared with £1000; but two shillings is a small small
quantity indeed, of a very secondary order. But what would be the
disproportion if the fraction, instead of being 1
100 , had been settled at
1
1000 part? Then, while Mr. Millionaire got his £1000, Mr. Secretary
would get only £1, and the boy less than one farthing!

“And these have smaller Fleas to bite ’em,
“And so proceed ad infinitum.”

An ox might worry about a flea of ordinary size—a small creature of
the first order of smallness. But he would probably not trouble himself
about a flea’s flea; being of the second order of smallness, it would be
negligible. Even a gross of fleas’ fleas would not be of much account to
the ox.
CHAPTER III.
ON RELATIVE GROWINGS.
All through the calculus we are dealing with quantities that are growing,
and with rates of growth. We classify all quantities into two classes:
constants and variables. Those which we regard as of fixed value, and
call constants, we generally denote algebraically by letters from the beginning
of the alphabet, such as a, b, or c; while those which we consider
as capable of growing, or (as mathematicians say) of “varying,” we denote
by letters from the end of the alphabet, such as x, y, z, u, v, w,
or sometimes t.
Moreover, we are usually dealing with more than one variable at
once, and thinking of the way in which one variable depends on the
other: for instance, we think of the way in which the height reached
by a projectile depends on the time of attaining that height. Or we
are asked to consider a rectangle of given area, and to enquire how any
increase in the length of it will compel a corresponding decrease in the
breadth of it. Or we think of the way in which any variation in the
slope of a ladder will cause the height that it reaches, to vary.
Suppose we have got two such variables that depend one on the
other. An alteration in one will bring about an alteration in the other,
because of this dependence. Let us call one of the variables x, and the
CALCULUS MADE EASY 10
other that depends on it y.
Suppose we make x to vary, that is to say, we either alter it or
imagine it to be altered, by adding to it a bit which we call dx. We are
thus causing x to become x + dx. Then, because x has been altered,
y will have altered also, and will have become y + dy. Here the bit dy
may be in some cases positive, in others negative; and it won’t (except
by a miracle) be the same size as dx.
Take two examples.
(1) Let x and y be respectively the base and the height of a rightangled
triangle (Fig. 4), of which the slope of the other side is fixed
x dx
y y
dy
30◦
Fig. 4.
at 30◦
. If we suppose this triangle to expand and yet keep its angles
the same as at first, then, when the base grows so as to become x + dx,
the height becomes y + dy. Here, increasing x results in an increase
of y. The little triangle, the height of which is dy, and the base of which
is dx, is similar to the original triangle; and it is obvious that the value
of the ratio dy
dx is the same as that of the ratio y
x
. As the angle is 30◦
it will be seen that here
dy
dx =
1
1.73
.
ON RELATIVE GROWINGS 11
(2) Let x represent, in Fig. 5, the horizontal distance, from a wall,
of the bottom end of a ladder, AB, of fixed length; and let y be the
x
y
O A
B
Fig. 5.
height it reaches up the wall. Now y clearly depends on x. It is easy to
see that, if we pull the bottom end A a bit further from the wall, the
top end B will come down a little lower. Let us state this in scientific
language. If we increase x to x+dx, then y will become y −dy; that is,
when x receives a positive increment, the increment which results to y
is negative.
Yes, but how much? Suppose the ladder was so long that when the
bottom end A was 19 inches from the wall the top end B reached just
15 feet from the ground. Now, if you were to pull the bottom end out
1 inch more, how much would the top end come down? Put it all into
inches: x = 19 inches, y = 180 inches. Now the increment of x which
we call dx, is 1 inch: or x + dx = 20 inches.
CALCULUS MADE EASY 12
How much will y be diminished? The new height will be y − dy. If
we work out the height by Euclid I. 47, then we shall be able to find
how much dy will be. The length of the ladder is
p
(180)2 + (19)2 = 181 inches.
Clearly then, the new height, which is y − dy, will be such that
(y − dy)
2 = (181)2 − (20)2 = 32761 − 400 = 32361,
y − dy =
√
32361 = 179.89 inches.
Now y is 180, so that dy is 180 − 179.89 = 0.11 inch.
So we see that making dx an increase of 1 inch has resulted in
making dy a decrease of 0.11 inch.
And the ratio of dy to dx may be stated thus:
dy
dx = −
0.11
1
.
It is also easy to see that (except in one particular position) dy will
be of a different size from dx.
Now right through the differential calculus we are hunting, hunting,
hunting for a curious thing, a mere ratio, namely, the proportion which
dy bears to dx when both of them are indefinitely small.
It should be noted here that we can only find this ratio dy
dx when
y and x are related to each other in some way, so that whenever x varies
y does vary also. For instance, in the first example just taken, if the
base x of the triangle be made longer, the height y of the triangle
becomes greater also, and in the second example, if the distance x of
the foot of the ladder from the wall be made to increase, the height y
ON RELATIVE GROWINGS 13
reached by the ladder decreases in a corresponding manner, slowly at
first, but more and more rapidly as x becomes greater. In these cases
the relation between x and y is perfectly definite, it can be expressed
mathematically, being y
x
= tan 30◦ and x
2 + y
2 = l
2
(where l is the
length of the ladder) respectively, and dy
dx has the meaning we found in
each case.
If, while x is, as before, the distance of the foot of the ladder from
the wall, y is, instead of the height reached, the horizontal length of
the wall, or the number of bricks in it, or the number of years since it
was built, any change in x would naturally cause no change whatever
in y; in this case dy
dx has no meaning whatever, and it is not possible
to find an expression for it. Whenever we use differentials dx, dy,
dz, etc., the existence of some kind of relation between x, y, z, etc., is
implied, and this relation is called a “function” in x, y, z, etc.; the two
expressions given above, for instance, namely y
x
= tan 30◦ and x
2+y
2 =
l
2
, are functions of x and y. Such expressions contain implicitly (that
is, contain without distinctly showing it) the means of expressing either
x in terms of y or y in terms of x, and for this reason they are called
implicit functions in x and y; they can be respectively put into the
forms
y = x tan 30◦
or x =
y
tan 30◦
and y =
√
l
2 − x
2 or x =
p
l
2 − y
2
.
These last expressions state explicitly (that is, distinctly) the value
of x in terms of y, or of y in terms of x, and they are for this reason
called explicit functions of x or y. For example x
2 + 3 = 2y − 7 is an
CALCULUS MADE EASY 14
implicit function in x and y; it may be written y =
x
2 + 10
2
(explicit
function of x) or x =
√
2y − 10 (explicit function of y). We see that
an explicit function in x, y, z, etc., is simply something the value of
which changes when x, y, z, etc., are changing, either one at the time
or several together. Because of this, the value of the explicit function
is called the dependent variable, as it depends on the value of the other
variable quantities in the function; these other variables are called the
independent variables because their value is not determined from the
value assumed by the function. For example, if u = x
2
sin θ, x and θ
are the independent variables, and u is the dependent variable.
Sometimes the exact relation between several quantities x, y, z either
is not known or it is not convenient to state it; it is only known,
or convenient to state, that there is some sort of relation between these
variables, so that one cannot alter either x or y or z singly without
affecting the other quantities; the existence of a function in x, y, z
is then indicated by the notation F(x, y, z) (implicit function) or by
x = F(y, z), y = F(x, z) or z = F(x, y) (explicit function). Sometimes
the letter f or φ is used instead of F, so that y = F(x), y = f(x) and
y = φ(x) all mean the same thing, namely, that the value of y depends
on the value of x in some way which is not stated.
We call the ratio dy
dx “the differential coefficient of y with respect
to x.” It is a solemn scientific name for this very simple thing. But
we are not going to be frightened by solemn names, when the things
themselves are so easy. Instead of being frightened we will simply pronounce
a brief curse on the stupidity of giving long crack-jaw names;
and, having relieved our minds, will go on to the simple thing itself,
ON RELATIVE GROWINGS 15
namely the ratio dy
dx.
In ordinary algebra which you learned at school, you were always
hunting after some unknown quantity which you called x or y; or sometimes
there were two unknown quantities to be hunted for simultaneously.
You have now to learn to go hunting in a new way; the fox being
now neither x nor y. Instead of this you have to hunt for this curious
cub called dy
dx. The process of finding the value of dy
dx is called “differentiating.”
But, remember, what is wanted is the value of this ratio
when both dy and dx are themselves indefinitely small. The true value
of the differential coefficient is that to which it approximates in the
limiting case when each of them is considered as infinitesimally minute.
Let us now learn how to go in quest of dy
dx.
CALCULUS MADE EASY 16
NOTE TO CHAPTER III.
How to read Differentials.
It will never do to fall into the schoolboy error of thinking that dx
means d times x, for d is not a factor—it means “an element of” or “a
bit of” whatever follows. One reads dx thus: “dee-eks.”
In case the reader has no one to guide him in such matters it may
here be simply said that one reads differential coefficients in the following
way. The differential coefficient
dy
dx is read “dee-wy by dee-eks,” or “dee-wy over dee-eks.”
So also du
dt is read “dee-you by dee-tee.”
Second differential coefficients will be met with later on. They are
like this:
d
2
y
dx2
; which is read “dee-two-wy over dee-eks-squared,”
and it means that the operation of differentiating y with respect to x
has been (or has to be) performed twice over.
Another way of indicating that a function has been differentiated is
by putting an accent to the symbol of the function. Thus if y = F(x),
which means that y is some unspecified function of x (see p. 13), we may
write F
0
(x) instead of d

F(x)

dx . Similarly, F
00(x) will mean that the
original function F(x) has been differentiated twice over with respect
to x.
CHAPTER IV.
SIMPLEST CASES.
Now let us see how, on first principles, we can differentiate some simple
algebraical expression.
Case 1.
Let us begin with the simple expression y = x
2
. Now remember
that the fundamental notion about the calculus is the idea of growing.
Mathematicians call it varying. Now as y and x
2 are equal to one
another, it is clear that if x grows, x
2 will also grow. And if x
2 grows,
then y will also grow. What we have got to find out is the proportion
between the growing of y and the growing of x. In other words our task
is to find out the ratio between dy and dx, or, in brief, to find the value
of dy
dx.
Let x, then, grow a little bit bigger and become x + dx; similarly,
y will grow a bit bigger and will become y+dy. Then, clearly, it will still
be true that the enlarged y will be equal to the square of the enlarged x.
Writing this down, we have:
y + dy = (x + dx)
2
.
CALCULUS MADE EASY 18
Doing the squaring we get:
y + dy = x
2 + 2x · dx + (dx)
2
.
What does (dx)
2 mean? Remember that dx meant a bit—a little
bit—of x. Then (dx)
2 will mean a little bit of a little bit of x; that
is, as explained above (p. 4), it is a small quantity of the second order
of smallness. It may therefore be discarded as quite inconsiderable in
comparison with the other terms. Leaving it out, we then have:
y + dy = x
2 + 2x · dx.
Now y = x
2
; so let us subtract this from the equation and we have
left
dy = 2x · dx.
Dividing across by dx, we find
dy
dx = 2x.
Now this∗
is what we set out to find. The ratio of the growing of y
to the growing of x is, in the case before us, found to be 2x.
∗N.B.—This ratio dy
dx is the result of differentiating y with respect to x. Differentiating
means finding the differential coefficient. Suppose we had some other
function of x, as, for example, u = 7x
2 + 3. Then if we were told to differentiate this
with respect to x, we should have to find du
dx, or, what is the same thing, d(7x
2 + 3)
dx .
On the other hand, we may have a case in which time was the independent variable
(see p. 14), such as this: y = b+

SIMPLEST CASES 19
Numerical example.
Suppose x = 100 and ∴ y = 10, 000. Then let x grow till it becomes
101 (that is, let dx = 1). Then the enlarged y will be 101 × 101 =
10, 201. But if we agree that we may ignore small quantities of the
second order, 1 may be rejected as compared with 10, 000; so we may
round off the enlarged y to 10, 200. y has grown from 10, 000 to 10, 200;
the bit added on is dy, which is therefore 200.
dy
dx =
200
1
= 200. According to the algebra-working of the previous
paragraph, we find dy
dx = 2x. And so it is; for x = 100 and 2x = 200.
But, you will say, we neglected a whole unit.
Well, try again, making dx a still smaller bit.
Try dx =
1
10 . Then x + dx = 100.1, and
(x + dx)
2 = 100.1 × 100.1 = 10, 020.01.
Now the last figure 1 is only one-millionth part of the 10, 000, and
is utterly negligible; so we may take 10, 020 without the little decimal
at the end. And this makes dy = 20; and dy
dx =
20
0.1
= 200, which is
still the same as 2x.
Case 2.
Try differentiating y = x
3
in the same way.
We let y grow to y + dy, while x grows to x + dx.
Then we have
y + dy = (x + dx)
3
.
Doing the cubing we obtain
y + dy = x
3 + 3x
2
· dx + 3x(dx)
2 + (dx)
3
.
CALCULUS MADE EASY 20
Now we know that we may neglect small quantities of the second
and third orders; since, when dy and dx are both made indefinitely
small, (dx)
2 and (dx)
3 will become indefinitely smaller by comparison.
So, regarding them as negligible, we have left:
y + dy = x
3 + 3x
2
· dx.
But y = x
3
; and, subtracting this, we have:
dy = 3x
2
· dx,
and dy
dx = 3x
2
.
Case 3.
Try differentiating y = x
4
. Starting as before by letting both y and x
grow a bit, we have:
y + dy = (x + dx)

.
Working out the raising to the fourth power, we get
y + dy = x
4 + 4x
3
dx + 6x
2
(dx)
2 + 4x(dx)
3 + (dx)

Then striking out the terms containing all the higher powers of dx,
as being negligible by comparison, we have
y + dy = x
4 + 4x
3
dx.
Subtracting the original y = x

, we have left
dy = 4x

and dy

SIMPLEST CASES 21
Now all these cases are quite easy. Let us collect the results to see if
we can infer any general rule. Put them in two columns, the values of y

Just look at these results: the operation of differentiating appears
to have had the effect of diminishing the power of x by 1 (for example
in the last case reducing x
4
to x
3
), and at the same time multiplying by
a number (the same number in fact which originally appeared as the
power). Now, when you have once seen this, you might easily conjecture
how the others will run. You would expect that differentiating x
5 would
give 5x
4
, or differentiating x
6 would give 6x
5
. If you hesitate, try one
of these, and see whether the conjecture comes right.

CALCULUS MADE EASY 22
and subtracting y = x

leaves us
dy = 5x

whence dy
dx = 5x

, exactly as we supposed.
Following out logically our observation, we should conclude that if
we want to deal with any higher power,—call it n—we could tackle it
in the same way.
Let y = x
n
,
then, we should expect to find that
dy
dx = nx(n−1)
.
For example, let n = 8, then y = x
8
; and differentiating it would
give
dy
dx = 8x
7
.
And, indeed, the rule that differentiating x
n gives as the result nxn−1
is true for all cases where n is a whole number and positive. [Expanding
(x + dx)
n by the binomial theorem will at once show this.] But the
question whether it is true for cases where n has negative or fractional
values requires further consideration.

CHAPTER V.
NEXT STAGE. WHAT TO DO WITH CONSTANTS.
In our equations we have regarded x as growing, and as a result of x
being made to grow y also changed its value and grew. We usually
think of x as a quantity that we can vary; and, regarding the variation
of x as a sort of cause, we consider the resulting variation of y as an
effect. In other words, we regard the value of y as depending on that
of x. Both x and y are variables, but x is the one that we operate upon,
and y is the “dependent variable.” In all the preceding chapter we have
been trying to find out rules for the proportion which the dependent
variation in y bears to the variation independently made in x.
Our next step is to find out what effect on the process of differentiating
is caused by the presence of constants, that is, of numbers which
don’t change when x or y change their values.
Added Constants.
Let us begin with some simple case of an added constant, thus:
Let y = x
3 + 5.
Just as before, let us suppose x to grow to x+dx and y to grow to y+dy.
CALCULUS MADE EASY 26
Then: y + dy = (x + dx)
3 + 5
= x
3 + 3x
2
dx + 3x(dx)
2 + (dx)
3 + 5.
Neglecting the small quantities of higher orders, this becomes
y + dy = x
3 + 3x
2
· dx + 5.
Subtract the original y = x
3 + 5, and we have left:
dy = 3x
2
dx.
dy
dx = 3x
2
.
So the 5 has quite disappeared. It added nothing to the growth
of x, and does not enter into the differential coefficient. If we had put 7,
or 700, or any other number, instead of 5, it would have disappeared.
So if we take the letter a, or b, or c to represent any constant, it will
simply disappear when we differentiate.
If the additional constant had been of negative value, such as
−5 or −b, it would equally have disappeared.
Multiplied Constants.
Take as a simple experiment this case:
Let y = 7x
2
.
Then on proceeding as before we get:
y + dy = 7(x + dx)
2
= 7{x
2 + 2x · dx + (dx)
2
}
= 7x
2 + 14x · dx + 7(dx)
2
.
WHAT TO DO WITH CONSTANTS 27
Then, subtracting the original y = 7x
2
, and neglecting the last term,
we have
dy = 14x · dx.
dy
dx = 14x.
Let us illustrate this example by working out the graphs of the
equations y = 7x
2 and dy
dx = 14x, by assigning to x a set of successive
values, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., and finding the corresponding values of y and
of dy
dx.
These values we tabulate as follows:
x 0 1 2 3 4 5 −1 −2 −3
y 0 7 28 63 112 175 7 28 63
dy
dx 0 14 28 42 56 70 −14 −28 −42
Now plot these values to some convenient scale, and we obtain the
two curves, Figs. 6 and 6a.
Carefully compare the two figures, and verify by inspection that
the height of the ordinate of the derived curve, Fig. 6a, is proportional
to the slope of the original curve,∗ Fig. 6, at the corresponding value
of x. To the left of the origin, where the original curve slopes negatively
(that is, downward from left to right) the corresponding ordinates of
the derived curve are negative.
Now if we look back at p. 18, we shall see that simply differentiating
x
2 gives us 2x. So that the differential coefficient of 7x
2
is just
∗See p. 76 about slopes of curves.

2
, the differential coeffi-
cient would have come out eight times as great as that of x

. If we put
y = ax2
, we shall get
dy
dx = a × 2x.
If we had begun with y = axn
, we should have had dy
dx = a×nxn−1
.
So that any mere multiplication by a constant reappears as a mere
multiplication when the thing is differentiated. And, what is true about
multiplication is equally true about division: for if, in the example
above, we had taken as the constant 1
7
instead of 7, we should have had
the same 1
7
come out in the result after differentiation.
Some Further Examples.
The following further examples, fully worked out, will enable you to

whether the expression can be put in a simpler form.

(4) The volume of a cylinder of radius r and height h is given by
the formula V = πr2h. Find the rate of variation of volume with the
radius when r = 5.5 in. and h = 20 in. If r = h, find the dimensions
of the cylinder so that a change of 1 in. in radius causes a change of
400 cub. in. in the volume.
The rate of variation of V with regard to r is
dV
dr = 2πrh.
If r = 5.5 in. and h = 20 in. this becomes 690.8. It means
that a change of radius of 1 inch will cause a change of volume of
690.8 cub. inch. This can be easily verified, for the volumes with
r = 5 and r = 6 are 1570 cub. in. and 2260.8 cub. in. respectively, and
2260.8 − 1570 = 690.8.

CHAPTER VI.
SUMS, DIFFERENCES, PRODUCTS AND
QUOTIENTS.
We have learned how to differentiate simple algebraical functions such
as x
2 + c or ax4
, and we have now to consider how to tackle the sum
of two or more functions.
For instance, let
y = (x
2 + c) + (ax4 + b);
what will its dy
dx be? How are we to go to work on this new job?
The answer to this question is quite simple: just differentiate them,
one after the other, thus:
dy
dx = 2x + 4ax3
. (Ans.)
If you have any doubt whether this is right, try a more general case,
working it by first principles. And this is the way.
Let y = u+v, where u is any function of x, and v any other function
of x. Then, letting x increase to x + dx, y will increase to y + dy; and
u will increase to u + du; and v to v + dv.
And we shall have:
y + dy = u + du + v + dv.
SUMS, DIFFERENCES, PRODUCTS 35
Subtracting the original y = u + v, we get
dy = du + dv,
and dividing through by dx, we get:
dy
dx =
du
dx +
dv
dx.
This justifies the procedure. You differentiate each function separately
and add the results. So if now we take the example of the
preceding paragraph, and put in the values of the two functions, we
shall have, using the notation shown (p. 16),
dy
dx =
d(x
2 + c)
dx +
d(ax4 + b)
dx
= 2x + 4ax3
,
exactly as before.
If there were three functions of x, which we may call u, v and w, so
that
y = u + v + w;
then dy
dx =
du
dx +
dv
dx +
dw
dx .
As for subtraction, it follows at once; for if the function v had itself
had a negative sign, its differential coefficient would also be negative;
so that by differentiating
y = u − v,
we should get dy
dx =
du
dx −
dv
dx.
CALCULUS MADE EASY 36
But when we come to do with Products, the thing is not quite so
simple.
Suppose we were asked to differentiate the expression
y = (x
2 + c) × (ax4 + b),
what are we to do? The result will certainly not be 2x × 4ax3
; for it
is easy to see that neither c × ax4
, nor x
2 × b, would have been taken
into that product.
Now there are two ways in which we may go to work.
First way. Do the multiplying first, and, having worked it out, then
differentiate.
Accordingly, we multiply together x
2 + c and ax4 + b.
This gives ax6 + acx4 + bx2 + bc.
Now differentiate, and we get:
dy
dx = 6ax5 + 4acx3 + 2bx.
Second way. Go back to first principles, and consider the equation
y = u × v;
where u is one function of x, and v is any other function of x. Then, if
x grows to be x + dx; and y to y + dy; and u becomes u + du, and v
becomes v + dv, we shall have:
y + dy = (u + du) × (v + dv)
= u · v + u · dv + v · du + du · dv.
SUMS, DIFFERENCES, PRODUCTS 37
Now du·dv is a small quantity of the second order of smallness, and
therefore in the limit may be discarded, leaving
y + dy = u · v + u · dv + v · du.
Then, subtracting the original y = u · v, we have left
dy = u · dv + v · du;
and, dividing through by dx, we get the result:
dy
dx = u
dv
dx + v
du
dx.
This shows that our instructions will be as follows: To differentiate
the product of two functions, multiply each function by the differential
coefficient of the other, and add together the two products so obtained.
You should note that this process amounts to the following: Treat u
as constant while you differentiate v; then treat v as constant while you
differentiate u; and the whole differential coefficient dy
dx will be the sum
of these two treatments.
Now, having found this rule, apply it to the concrete example which
was considered above.
We want to differentiate the product
(x
2 + c) × (ax4 + b).
Call (x
2 + c) = u; and (ax4 + b) = v.
CALCULUS MADE EASY 38
Then, by the general rule just established, we may write:
dy
dx = (x
2 + c)
d(ax4 + b)
dx + (ax4 + b)
d(x
2 + c)
dx
= (x
2 + c) 4ax3 + (ax4 + b) 2x
= 4ax5 + 4acx3 + 2ax5 + 2bx,
dy
dx = 6ax5 + 4acx3 + 2bx,
exactly as before.
Lastly, we have to differentiate quotients.
Think of this example, y =
bx5 + c
x
2 + a
. In such a case it is no use to
try to work out the division beforehand, because x
2 + a will not divide
into bx5 + c, neither have they any common factor. So there is nothing
for it but to go back to first principles, and find a rule.
So we will put y =
u
v
;
where u and v are two different functions of the independent variable x.
Then, when x becomes x+dx, y will become y +dy; and u will become
u + du; and v will become v + dv. So then
y + dy =
u + du
v + dv .

As both these remainders are small quantities of the second order,
they may be neglected, and the division may stop here, since any further
remainders would be of still smaller magnitudes.

This gives us our instructions as to how to differentiate a quotient
of two functions. Multiply the divisor function by the differential coef-
ficient of the dividend function; then multiply the dividend function by
the differential coefficient of the divisor function; and subtract. Lastly
divide by the square of the divisor function.

Sixth differentiation, = 0.
There is a certain notation, with which we are already acquainted
(see p. 14), used by some writers, that is very convenient. This is
to employ the general symbol f(x) for any function of x. Here the
symbol f( ) is read as “function of,” without saying what particular
function is meant. So the statement y = f(x) merely tells us that y is
a function of x, it may be x
2 or axn
, or cos x or any other complicated
function of x.
SUCCESSIVE DIFFERENTIATION 49
The corresponding symbol for the differential coefficient is f
0
(x),
which is simpler to write than dy
dx. This is called the “derived function”
of x.
Suppose we differentiate over again, we shall get the “second derived
function” or second differential coefficient, which is denoted by f
00(x);
and so on.
Now let us generalize.
Let y = f(x) = x

(x) = nxn−1

Second differentiation, f
00(x) = n(n − 1)x

etc., etc.
But this is not the only way of indicating successive differentiations.
For,
if the original function be y = f(x);
once differentiating gives dy
dx = f

(x);
twice differentiating gives

CHAPTER VIII.
WHEN TIME VARIES.
Some of the most important problems of the calculus are those where
time is the independent variable, and we have to think about the values
of some other quantity that varies when the time varies. Some things
grow larger as time goes on; some other things grow smaller. The distance
that a train has got from its starting place goes on ever increasing
as time goes on. Trees grow taller as the years go by. Which is growing
at the greater rate; a plant 12 inches high which in one month becomes
14 inches high, or a tree 12 feet high which in a year becomes 14 feet
high?
In this chapter we are going to make much use of the word rate.
Nothing to do with poor-rate, or water-rate (except that even here the
word suggests a proportion—a ratio—so many pence in the pound).
Nothing to do even with birth-rate or death-rate, though these words
suggest so many births or deaths per thousand of the population. When
a motor-car whizzes by us, we say: What a terrific rate! When a
spendthrift is flinging about his money, we remark that that young
man is living at a prodigious rate. What do we mean by rate? In
both these cases we are making a mental comparison of something that
is happening, and the length of time that it takes to happen. If the
WHEN TIME VARIES 53
motor-car flies past us going 10 yards per second, a simple bit of mental
arithmetic will show us that this is equivalent—while it lasts—to a rate
of 600 yards per minute, or over 20 miles per hour.
Now in what sense is it true that a speed of 10 yards per second
is the same as 600 yards per minute? Ten yards is not the same as
600 yards, nor is one second the same thing as one minute. What we
mean by saying that the rate is the same, is this: that the proportion
borne between distance passed over and time taken to pass over it, is
the same in both cases.
Take another example. A man may have only a few pounds in his
possession, and yet be able to spend money at the rate of millions
a year—provided he goes on spending money at that rate for a few
minutes only. Suppose you hand a shilling over the counter to pay
for some goods; and suppose the operation lasts exactly one second.
Then, during that brief operation, you are parting with your money
at the rate of 1 shilling per second, which is the same rate as £3 per
minute, or £180 per hour, or £4320 per day, or £1, 576, 800 per year!
If you have £10 in your pocket, you can go on spending money at the
rate of a million a year for just 5 1
4 minutes.
It is said that Sandy had not been in London above five minutes
when “bang went saxpence.” If he were to spend money at that rate
all day long, say for 12 hours, he would be spending 6 shillings an hour,
or £3. 12s. per day, or £21. 12s. a week, not counting the Sawbbath.
Now try to put some of these ideas into differential notation.
Let y in this case stand for money, and let t stand for time.
If you are spending money, and the amount you spend in a short
CALCULUS MADE EASY 54
time dt be called dy, the rate of spending it will be dy
dt , or rather, should
be written with a minus sign, as −
dy
dt , because dy is a decrement, not an
increment. But money is not a good example for the calculus, because
it generally comes and goes by jumps, not by a continuous flow—you
may earn £200 a year, but it does not keep running in all day long
in a thin stream; it comes in only weekly, or monthly, or quarterly, in
lumps: and your expenditure also goes out in sudden payments.
A more apt illustration of the idea of a rate is furnished by the
speed of a moving body. From London (Euston station) to Liverpool is
200 miles. If a train leaves London at 7 o’clock, and reaches Liverpool
at 11 o’clock, you know that, since it has travelled 200 miles in 4 hours,
its average rate must have been 50 miles per hour; because 200
4 =
50
1
.
Here you are really making a mental comparison between the distance
passed over and the time taken to pass over it. You are dividing one
by the other. If y is the whole distance, and t the whole time, clearly
the average rate is y
t
. Now the speed was not actually constant all the
way: at starting, and during the slowing up at the end of the journey,
the speed was less. Probably at some part, when running downhill,
the speed was over 60 miles an hour. If, during any particular element
of time dt, the corresponding element of distance passed over was dy,
then at that part of the journey the speed was dy
dt . The rate at which
one quantity (in the present instance, distance) is changing in relation
to the other quantity (in this case, time) is properly expressed, then,
by stating the differential coefficient of one with respect to the other.
A velocity, scientifically expressed, is the rate at which a very small
distance in any given direction is being passed over; and may therefore
WHEN TIME VARIES 55
be written
v =
dy
dt .
But if the velocity v is not uniform, then it must be either increasing
or else decreasing. The rate at which a velocity is increasing is called the
acceleration. If a moving body is, at any particular instant, gaining an
additional velocity dv in an element of time dt, then the acceleration a
at that instant may be written
a =
dv
dt ;
but dv is itself d

dy
dt 
. Hence we may put
a =
d

dy
dt 
dt ;
and this is usually written a =
d
2
y
dt2
;
or the acceleration is the second differential coefficient of the distance,
with respect to time. Acceleration is expressed as a change of velocity
in unit time, for instance, as being so many feet per second per second;
the notation used being feet ÷ second2
.
When a railway train has just begun to move, its velocity v is small;
but it is rapidly gaining speed—it is being hurried up, or accelerated,
by the effort of the engine. So its d
2
y
dt2
is large. When it has got up its
top speed it is no longer being accelerated, so that then d
2
y
dt2
has fallen
to zero. But when it nears its stopping place its speed begins to slow
down; may, indeed, slow down very quickly if the brakes are put on,
CALCULUS MADE EASY 56
and during this period of deceleration or slackening of pace, the value
of dv
dt , that is, of d
2
y
dt2
will be negative.
To accelerate a mass m requires the continuous application of force.
The force necessary to accelerate a mass is proportional to the mass,
and it is also proportional to the acceleration which is being imparted.
Hence we may write for the force f, the expression
f = ma;
or f = m
dv
dt ;
or f = m
d
2
y
dt2
.
The product of a mass by the speed at which it is going is called its
momentum, and is in symbols mv. If we differentiate momentum with
respect to time we shall get d(mv)
dt for the rate of change of momentum.
But, since m is a constant quantity, this may be written m
dv
dt , which
we see above is the same as f. That is to say, force may be expressed
either as mass times acceleration, or as rate of change of momentum.
Again, if a force is employed to move something (against an equal
and opposite counter-force), it does work; and the amount of work done
is measured by the product of the force into the distance (in its own
direction) through which its point of application moves forward. So if
a force f moves forward through a length y, the work done (which we
may call w) will be
w = f × y;
where we take f as a constant force. If the force varies at different
parts of the range y, then we must find an expression for its value from
WHEN TIME VARIES 57
point to point. If f be the force along the small element of length dy,
the amount of work done will be f × dy. But as dy is only an element
of length, only an element of work will be done. If we write w for work,
then an element of work will be dw; and we have
dw = f × dy;
which may be written
dw = ma · dy;
or dw = m
d
2
y
dt2
· dy;
or dw = m
dv
dt · dy.
Further, we may transpose the expression and write
dw
dy = f.
This gives us yet a third definition of force; that if it is being used
to produce a displacement in any direction, the force (in that direction)
is equal to the rate at which work is being done per unit of length in
that direction. In this last sentence the word rate is clearly not used in
its time-sense, but in its meaning as ratio or proportion.
Sir Isaac Newton, who was (along with Leibnitz) an inventor of the
methods of the calculus, regarded all quantities that were varying as
flowing; and the ratio which we nowadays call the differential coefficient
he regarded as the rate of flowing, or the fluxion of the quantity in question.
He did not use the notation of the dy and dx, and dt (this was due
to Leibnitz), but had instead a notation of his own. If y was a quantity
CALCULUS MADE EASY 58
that varied, or “flowed,” then his symbol for its rate of variation (or
“fluxion”) was ˙y. If x was the variable, then its fluxion was called ˙x.
The dot over the letter indicated that it had been differentiated. But
this notation does not tell us what is the independent variable with
respect to which the differentiation has been effected. When we see dy
dt
we know that y is to be differentiated with respect to t. If we see dy
dx
we know that y is to be differentiated with respect to x. But if we see
merely ˙y, we cannot tell without looking at the context whether this is
to mean
dy
dx or
dy
dt or
dy
dz , or what is the other variable. So, therefore,
this fluxional notation is less informing than the differential notation,
and has in consequence largely dropped out of use. But its simplicity
gives it an advantage if only we will agree to use it for those cases exclusively
where time is the independent variable. In that case ˙y will
mean
dy
dt and ˙u will mean du
dt ; and ¨x will mean d
2x
dt2
.
Adopting this fluxional notation we may write the mechanical equations
considered in the paragraphs above, as follows:
distance x,
velocity v = ˙x,
acceleration a = ˙v = ¨x,
force f = mv˙ = mx¨,
work w = x × mx¨.
Examples.
(1) A body moves so that the distance x (in feet), which it travels
from a certain point O, is given by the relation x = 0.2t
2 + 10.4, where
t is the time in seconds elapsed since a certain instant. Find the velocity
WHEN TIME VARIES 59
and acceleration 5 seconds after the body began to move, and also
find the corresponding values when the distance covered is 100 feet.
Find also the average velocity during the first 10 seconds of its motion.
(Suppose distances and motion to the right to be positive.)
Now x = 0.2t
2 + 10.4
v = ˙x =
dx
dt = 0.4t; and a = ¨x =
d
2x
dt2
= 0.4 = constant.
When t = 0, x = 10.4 and v = 0. The body started from a point
10.4 feet to the right of the point O; and the time was reckoned from
the instant the body started.
When t = 5, v = 0.4 × 5 = 2 ft./sec.; a = 0.4 ft./sec2
.
When x = 100, 100 = 0.2t
2 + 10.4, or t
2 = 448, and t = 21.17 sec.;
v = 0.4 × 21.17 = 8.468 ft./sec.
When t = 10,
distance travelled = 0.2 × 102 + 10.4 − 10.4 = 20 ft.
Average velocity = 20
10 = 2 ft./sec.
(It is the same velocity as the velocity at the middle of the interval,
t = 5; for, the acceleration being constant, the velocity has varied
uniformly from zero when t = 0 to 4 ft./sec. when t = 10.)
(2) In the above problem let us suppose
x = 0.2t
2 + 3t + 10.4.
v = ˙x =
dx
dt = 0.4t + 3; a = ¨x =
d
2x
dt2
= 0.4 = constant.
When t = 0, x = 10.4 and v = 3 ft./sec, the time is reckoned from
the instant at which the body passed a point 10.4 ft. from the point O,
CALCULUS MADE EASY 60
its velocity being then already 3 ft./sec. To find the time elapsed since
it began moving, let v = 0; then 0.4t + 3 = 0, t = −
3
.4 = −7.5 sec.
The body began moving 7.5 sec. before time was begun to be observed;
5 seconds after this gives t = −2.5 and v = 0.4 × −2.5 + 3 = 2 ft./sec.
When x = 100 ft.,
100 = 0.2t
2 + 3t + 10.4; or t
2 + 15t − 448 = 0;
hence t = 14.95 sec., v = 0.4 × 14.95 + 3 = 8.98 ft./sec.
To find the distance travelled during the 10 first seconds of the
motion one must know how far the body was from the point O when it
started.
When t = −7.5,
x = 0.2 × (−7.5)2 − 3 × 7.5 + 10.4 = −0.85 ft.,
that is 0.85 ft. to the left of the point O.
Now, when t = 2.5,
x = 0.2 × 2.5
2 + 3 × 2.5 + 10.4 = 19.15.
So, in 10 seconds, the distance travelled was 19.15 + 0.85 = 20 ft.,
and
the average velocity = 20
10 = 2 ft./sec.
(3) Consider a similar problem when the distance is given by x =
0.2t
2 − 3t + 10.4. Then v = 0.4t − 3, a = 0.4 = constant. When
t = 0, x = 10.4 as before, and v = −3; so that the body was moving
in the direction opposite to its motion in the previous cases. As the
acceleration is positive, however, we see that this velocity will decrease
WHEN TIME VARIES 61
as time goes on, until it becomes zero, when v = 0 or 0.4t − 3 = 0; or
t = 7.5 sec. After this, the velocity becomes positive; and 5 seconds
after the body started, t = 12.5, and
v = 0.4 × 12.5 − 3 = 2 ft./sec.
When x = 100,
100 = 0.2t
2 − 3t + 10.4, or t
2 − 15t − 448 = 0,
and t = 29.95; v = 0.4 × 29.95 − 3 = 8.98 ft./sec.
When v is zero, x = 0.2 × 7.5
2 − 3 × 7.5 + 10.4 = −0.85, informing
us that the body moves back to 0.85 ft. beyond the point O before it
stops. Ten seconds later
t = 17.5 and x = 0.2 × 17.5
2 − 3 × 17.5 + 10.4 = 19.15.
The distance travelled = .85 + 19.15 = 20.0, and the average velocity
is again 2 ft./sec.
(4) Consider yet another problem of the same sort with x = 0.2t
3 −
3t
2 + 10.4; v = 0.6t
2 − 6t; a = 1.2t − 6. The acceleration is no more
constant.
When t = 0, x = 10.4, v = 0, a = −6. The body is at rest, but just
ready to move with a negative acceleration, that is to gain a velocity
towards the point O.
(5) If we have x = 0.2t
3−3t+10.4, then v = 0.6t
2−3, and a = 1.2t.
When t = 0, x = 10.4; v = −3; a = 0.
The body is moving towards the point O with a velocity of 3 ft./sec.,
and just at that instant the velocity is uniform.
CALCULUS MADE EASY 62
We see that the conditions of the motion can always be at once
ascertained from the time-distance equation and its first and second
derived functions. In the last two cases the mean velocity during the
first 10 seconds and the velocity 5 seconds after the start will no more
be the same, because the velocity is not increasing uniformly, the acceleration
being no longer constant.
(6) The angle θ (in radians) turned through by a wheel is given by
θ = 3 + 2t−0.1t
3
, where t is the time in seconds from a certain instant;
find the angular velocity ω and the angular acceleration α, (a) after
1 second; (b) after it has performed one revolution. At what time is it
at rest, and how many revolutions has it performed up to that instant?
Writing for the acceleration
ω = ˙θ =
dθ
dt = 2 − 0.3t
2
, α = ¨θ =
d
2
θ
dt2
= −0.6t.
When t = 0, θ = 3; ω = 2 rad./sec.; α = 0.
When t = 1,
ω = 2 − 0.3 = 1.7 rad./sec.; α = −0.6 rad./sec2
.
This is a retardation; the wheel is slowing down.
After 1 revolution
θ = 2π = 6.28; 6.28 = 3 + 2t − 0.1t
3
.
By plotting the graph, θ = 3 + 2t − 0.1t
3
, we can get the value or
values of t for which θ = 6.28; these are 2.11 and 3.03 (there is a third
negative value).
WHEN TIME VARIES 63
When t = 2.11,
θ = 6.28; ω = 2 − 1.34 = 0.66 rad./sec.;
α = −1.27 rad./sec2
.
When t = 3.03,
θ = 6.28; ω = 2 − 2.754 = −0.754 rad./sec.;
α = −1.82 rad./sec2
.
The velocity is reversed. The wheel is evidently at rest between
these two instants; it is at rest when ω = 0, that is when 0 = 2 − 0.3t
3
,
or when t = 2.58 sec., it has performed
θ
2π
=
3 + 2 × 2.58 − 0.1 × 2.583

= 1.025 revolutions.

INTRODUCING A USEFUL DODGE.
Sometimes one is stumped by finding that the expression to be differentiated
is too complicated to tackle directly.
Thus, the equation
y = (x

is awkward to a beginner.
Now the dodge to turn the difficulty is this: Write some symbol,
such as u, for the expression x

; then the equation becomes
y = u

which you can easily manage; for

Then tackle the expression

CHAPTER X.
GEOMETRICAL MEANING OF DIFFERENTIATION.
It is useful to consider what geometrical meaning can be given to the
differential coefficient.
In the first place, any function of x, such, for example, as x
2
, or √
x,
or ax + b, can be plotted as a curve; and nowadays every schoolboy is
familiar with the process of curve-plotting.

Fig. 7.
Let P QR, in Fig. 7, be a portion of a curve plotted with respect
to the axes of coordinates OX and OY . Consider any point Q on this
curve, where the abscissa of the point is x and its ordinate is y. Now
observe how y changes when x is varied. If x is made to increase by
CALCULUS MADE EASY 76
a small increment dx, to the right, it will be observed that y also (in
this particular curve) increases by a small increment dy (because this
particular curve happens to be an ascending curve). Then the ratio of
dy to dx is a measure of the degree to which the curve is sloping up
between the two points Q and T. As a matter of fact, it can be seen on
the figure that the curve between Q and T has many different slopes,
so that we cannot very well speak of the slope of the curve between
Q and T. If, however, Q and T are so near each other that the small
portion QT of the curve is practically straight, then it is true to say that
the ratio dy
dx is the slope of the curve along QT. The straight line QT
produced on either side touches the curve along the portion QT only,
and if this portion is indefinitely small, the straight line will touch the
curve at practically one point only, and be therefore a tangent to the
curve.
This tangent to the curve has evidently the same slope as QT, so
that dy
dx is the slope of the tangent to the curve at the point Q for which
the value of dy
dx is found.
We have seen that the short expression “the slope of a curve” has
no precise meaning, because a curve has so many slopes—in fact, every
small portion of a curve has a different slope. “The slope of a curve at
a point” is, however, a perfectly defined thing; it is the slope of a very
small portion of the curve situated just at that point; and we have seen
that this is the same as “the slope of the tangent to the curve at that
point.”
Observe that dx is a short step to the right, and dy the corresponding
short step upwards. These steps must be considered as short as
MEANING OF DIFFERENTIATION 77
possible—in fact indefinitely short,—though in diagrams we have to
represent them by bits that are not infinitesimally small, otherwise
they could not be seen.
We shall hereafter make considerable use of this circumstance that
dy
dx represents the slope of the curve at any point.

Fig. 8.
If a curve is sloping up at 45◦ at a particular point, as in Fig. 8, dy
and dx will be equal, and the value of dy
dx = 1.
If the curve slopes up steeper than 45◦
(Fig. 9), dy
dx will be greater
than 1.
If the curve slopes up very gently, as in Fig. 10,
dy
dx will be a fraction
smaller than 1.
For a horizontal line, or a horizontal place in a curve, dy = 0, and
therefore dy
dx = 0.
If a curve slopes downward, as in Fig. 11, dy will be a step down,
and must therefore be reckoned of negative value; hence dy
dx will have
negative sign also.

If the “curve” happens to be a straight line, like that in Fig. 12, the
value of dy
dx will be the same at all points along it. In other words its
slope is constant.
If a curve is one that turns more upwards as it goes along to the
right, the values of dy
dx will become greater and greater with the increasing
steepness, as in Fig. 13.
If a curve is one that gets flatter and flatter as it goes along, the
values of dy
dx will become smaller and smaller as the flatter part is

reached, as in Fig. 14.
If a curve first descends, and then goes up again, as in Fig. 15,
presenting a concavity upwards, then clearly dy
dx will first be negative,
with diminishing values as the curve flattens, then will be zero at the
point where the bottom of the trough of the curve is reached; and from
this point onward dy
dx will have positive values that go on increasing. In
such a case y is said to pass by a minimum. The minimum value of y is
not necessarily the smallest value of y, it is that value of y corresponding
to the bottom of the trough; for instance, in Fig. 28 (p. 99), the value
of y corresponding to the bottom of the trough is 1, while y takes

elsewhere values which are smaller than this. The characteristic of a
minimum is that y must increase on either side of it.
N.B.—For the particular value of x that makes y a minimum, the
value of dy
dx = 0.
If a curve first ascends and then descends, the values of dy
dx will be
positive at first; then zero, as the summit is reached; then negative,
as the curve slopes downwards, as in Fig. 16. In this case y is said to
pass by a maximum, but the maximum value of y is not necessarily the
greatest value of y. In Fig. 28, the maximum of y is 2 1
3
, but this is
by no means the greatest value y can have at some other point of the
curve.
N.B.—For the particular value of x that makes y a maximum, the
value of dy
dx = 0.
If a curve has the peculiar form of Fig. 17, the values of dy
dx will
always be positive; but there will be one particular place where the
slope is least steep, where the value of dy
dx will be a minimum; that is,
less than it is at any other part of the curve.

Now that we understand that dy
dx measures the steepness of a curve

learned how to differentiate.
CALCULUS MADE EASY 82
(1) As the simplest case take this:
y = x + b.
It is plotted out in Fig. 19, using equal scales for x and y. If we put
x = 0, then the corresponding ordinate will be y = b; that is to say, the
“curve” crosses the y-axis at the height b. From here it ascends at 45◦
;

for whatever values we give to x to the right, we have an equal y to
ascend. The line has a gradient of 1 in 1.
Now differentiate y = x + b, by the rules we have already learned
(pp. 21 and 25 ante), and we get dy
dx = 1.
The slope of the line is such that for every little step dx to the right,
we go an equal little step dy upward. And this slope is constant—always
the same slope.
(2) Take another case:
y = ax + b.
MEANING OF DIFFERENTIATION 83
We know that this curve, like the preceding one, will start from a
height b on the y-axis. But before we draw the curve, let us find its
slope by differentiating; which gives dy
dx = a. The slope will be constant,
at an angle, the tangent of which is here called a. Let us assign to a
some numerical value—say 1
3
. Then we must give it such a slope that
it ascends 1 in 3; or dx will be 3 times as great as dy; as magnified in
Fig. 21. So, draw the line in Fig. 20 at this slope.
Fig. 21.
(3) Now for a slightly harder case.
Let y = ax2 + b.
Again the curve will start on the y-axis at a height b above the
origin.
Now differentiate. [If you have forgotten, turn back to p. 25; or,
rather, don’t turn back, but think out the differentiation.]
dy
dx = 2ax.
This shows that the steepness will not be constant: it increases as
x increases. At the starting point P, where x = 0, the curve (Fig. 22)
has no steepness—that is, it is level. On the left of the origin, where x
has negative values, dy
dx will also have negative values, or will descend
from left to right, as in the Figure.

Now assign a few successive values, say from 0 to 5, to x; and calculate

the values of y against those of x and in Fig. 24 those of dy
dx against
those of x. For any assigned value of x, the height of the ordinate in
the second curve is proportional to the slope of the first curve.

If a curve comes to a sudden cusp, as in Fig. 25, the slope at that
point suddenly changes from a slope upward to a slope downward. In

that case dy
dx will clearly undergo an abrupt change from a positive to
a negative value.
The following examples show further applications of the principles
just explained.

(4) Find the slope of the tangent to the curve
y =
1
2x
+ 3,
at the point where x = −1. Find the angle which this tangent makes
with the curve y = 2x
2 + 2.
The slope of the tangent is the slope of the curve at the point where
they touch one another (see p. 76); that is, it is the dy
dx of the curve for
that point. Here dy
dx = −
1
2x
2
and for x = −1,
dy
dx = −
1
2
, which is the
slope of the tangent and of the curve at that point. The tangent, being
a straight line, has for equation y = ax + b, and its slope is dy
dx = a,
hence a = −
1
2
. Also if x = −1, y =
1
2(−1) + 3 = 2 1
2
; and as the
tangent passes by this point, the coordinates of the point must satisfy
the equation of the tangent, namely
y = −
1
2
x + b,
so that 2 1
2 = −
1
2
× (−1) + b and b = 2; the equation of the tangent is
therefore y = −
1
2
x + 2.
Now, when two curves meet, the intersection being a point common
to both curves, its coordinates must satisfy the equation of each
one of the two curves; that is, it must be a solution of the system of
simultaneous equations formed by coupling together the equations of
the curves. Here the curves meet one another at points given by the
solution of

that is, x(2x +

) = 0.
This equation has for its solutions x = 0 and x = −

. The slope of
the curve y = 2x
2 + 2 at any point is
dy
dx = 4x.
For the point where x = 0, this slope is zero; the curve is horizontal.
For the point where
x = −

4
,
dy
dx = −1;
hence the curve at that point slopes downwards to the right at such
an angle θ with the horizontal that tan θ = 1; that is, at 45◦
to the
horizontal.
The slope of the straight line is −
1
2
; that is, it slopes downwards to
the right and makes with the horizontal an angle φ such that tan φ =
1
2
;
that is, an angle of 26◦ 340
. It follows that at the first point the curve
cuts the straight line at an angle of 26◦ 340
, while at the second it cuts
it at an angle of 45◦ − 26◦ 340 = 18◦ 260
.
(5) A straight line is to be drawn, through a point whose coordinates
are x = 2, y = −1, as tangent to the curve y = x

coordinates of the point of contact.
The slope of the tangent must be the same as the dy
dx of the curve;
that is, 2x − 5.
The equation of the straight line is y = ax+b, and as it is satisfied for
the values x = 2, y = −1, then −1 = a×2+b; also, its dy
dx = a = 2x−5.
The x and the y of the point of contact must also satisfy both the
equation of the tangent and the equation of the curve.

Replacing a and b by their value in this, we get
x
2 − 5x + 6 = (2x − 5)x − 1 − 2(2x − 5),
which simplifies to x
2 − 4x + 3 = 0, the solutions of which are: x = 3
and x = 1. Replacing in (i), we get y = 0 and y = 2 respectively; the
two points of contact are then x = 1, y = 2, and x = 3, y = 0.

instructive to verify the deductions obtained by actually plotting

CHAPTER XI.
MAXIMA AND MINIMA.
One of the principal uses of the process of differentiating is to find out
under what conditions the value of the thing differentiated becomes a
maximum, or a minimum. This is often exceedingly important in engineering
questions, where it is most desirable to know what conditions
will make the cost of working a minimum, or will make the efficiency a
maximum.
Now, to begin with a concrete case, let us take the equation
y = x
2 − 4x + 7.
By assigning a number of successive values to x, and finding the corresponding
values of y, we can readily see that the equation represents
a curve with a minimum.
x 0 1 2 3 4 5
y 7 4 3 4 7 12
These values are plotted in Fig. 26, which shows that y has apparently
a minimum value of 3, when x is made equal to 2. But are you
sure that the minimum occurs at 2, and not at 2 1
4
or at 1 3

?

Of course it would be possible with any algebraic expression to work
out a lot of values, and in this way arrive gradually at the particular
value that may be a maximum or a minimum.

MAXIMA AND MINIMA 93
Calculate a few values thus:
x −1 0 1 2 3 4 5
y −4 0 2 2 0 −4 −10
Plot these values as in Fig. 27.
It will be evident that there will be a maximum somewhere between
x = 1 and x = 2; and the thing looks as if the maximum value of y ought
to be about 2 1
4
. Try some intermediate values. If x = 1 1
4
, y = 2.187; if
x = 1 1
2
, y = 2.25; if x = 1.6, y = 2.24. How can we be sure that 2.25 is
the real maximum, or that it occurs exactly when x = 1 1
2
?
Now it may sound like juggling to be assured that there is a way
by which one can arrive straight at a maximum (or minimum) value
without making a lot of preliminary trials or guesses. And that way
depends on differentiating. Look back to an earlier page (78) for the
remarks about Figs. 14 and 15, and you will see that whenever a curve
gets either to its maximum or to its minimum height, at that point its
dy
dx = 0. Now this gives us the clue to the dodge that is wanted. When
there is put before you an equation, and you want to find that value
of x that will make its y a minimum (or a maximum), first differentiate
it, and having done so, write its dy
dx as equal to zero, and then solve
for x. Put this particular value of x into the original equation, and you
will then get the required value of y. This process is commonly called
“equating to zero.”
To see how simply it works, take the example with which this chapter
opens, namely
y = x
2 − 4x + 7.
CALCULUS MADE EASY 94
Differentiating, we get:
dy
dx = 2x − 4.
Now equate this to zero, thus:
2x − 4 = 0.
Solving this equation for x, we get:
2x = 4,
x = 2.
Now, we know that the maximum (or minimum) will occur exactly
when x = 2.
Putting the value x = 2 into the original equation, we get
y = 22 − (4 × 2) + 7
= 4 − 8 + 7
= 3.
Now look back at Fig. 26, and you will see that the minimum occurs
when x = 2, and that this minimum of y = 3.
Try the second example (Fig. 24), which is
y = 3x − x
2
.
Differentiating, dy
dx = 3 − 2x.
Equating to zero,
3 − 2x = 0,
whence x = 1 1
2
;
MAXIMA AND MINIMA 95
and putting this value of x into the original equation, we find:
y = 4 1
2 − (1 1
2 × 1
1
2
),
y = 2 1
4
.
This gives us exactly the information as to which the method of trying
a lot of values left us uncertain.
Now, before we go on to any further cases, we have two remarks to
make. When you are told to equate dy
dx to zero, you feel at first (that
is if you have any wits of your own) a kind of resentment, because you
know that dy
dx has all sorts of different values at different parts of the
curve, according to whether it is sloping up or down. So, when you are
suddenly told to write
dy
dx = 0,
you resent it, and feel inclined to say that it can’t be true. Now you will
have to understand the essential difference between “an equation,” and
“an equation of condition.” Ordinarily you are dealing with equations
that are true in themselves, but, on occasions, of which the present are
examples, you have to write down equations that are not necessarily
true, but are only true if certain conditions are to be fulfilled; and you
write them down in order, by solving them, to find the conditions which
make them true. Now we want to find the particular value that x has
when the curve is neither sloping up nor sloping down, that is, at the
particular place where dy
dx = 0. So, writing dy
dx = 0 does not mean that
it always is = 0; but you write it down as a condition in order to see
how much x will come out if dy
dx is to be zero.

The second remark is one which (if you have any wits of your own)
you will probably have already made: namely, that this much-belauded
process of equating to zero entirely fails to tell you whether the x that
you thereby find is going to give you a maximum value of y or a minimum
value of y. Quite so. It does not of itself discriminate; it finds
for you the right value of x but leaves you to find out for yourselves
whether the corresponding y is a maximum or a minimum. Of course,
if you have plotted the curve, you know already which it will be.
For instance, take the equation:
y = 4x +
1
x
.
Without stopping to think what curve it corresponds to, differentiate
it, and equate to zero:
dy
dx = 4 − x
−2 = 4 −
1
x
2
= 0;
whence x =
1
2
;
and, inserting this value,
y = 4
will be either a maximum or else a minimum. But which? You will
hereafter be told a way, depending upon a second differentiation, (see
Chap. XII., p. 109). But at present it is enough if you will simply
try any other value of x differing a little from the one found, and see
whether with this altered value the corresponding value of y is less or
greater than that already found.
MAXIMA AND MINIMA 97
Try another simple problem in maxima and minima. Suppose you
were asked to divide any number into two parts, such that the product
was a maximum? How would you set about it if you did not know the
trick of equating to zero? I suppose you could worry it out by the rule
of try, try, try again. Let 60 be the number. You can try cutting it into
two parts, and multiplying them together. Thus, 50 times 10 is 500; 52
times 8 is 416; 40 times 20 is 800; 45 times 15 is 675; 30 times 30 is 900.
This looks like a maximum: try varying it. 31 times 29 is 899, which is
not so good; and 32 times 28 is 896, which is worse. So it seems that
the biggest product will be got by dividing into two equal halves.
Now see what the calculus tells you. Let the number to be cut into
two parts be called n. Then if x is one part, the other will be n − x,
and the product will be x(n − x) or nx − x
2
. So we write y = nx − x
2
.
Now differentiate and equate to zero;
dy
dx = n − 2x = 0
Solving for x, we get
n
2
= x.
So now we know that whatever number n may be, we must divide it
into two equal parts if the product of the parts is to be a maximum;
and the value of that maximum product will always be = 1
4
n
2
.
This is a very useful rule, and applies to any number of factors, so
that if m + n + p = a constant number, m × n × p is a maximum when
m = n = p.
CALCULUS MADE EASY 98
Test Case.
Let us at once apply our knowledge to a case that we can test.
Let y = x
2 − x;
and let us find whether this function has a maximum or minimum; and
if so, test whether it is a maximum or a minimum.
Differentiating, we get
dy
dx = 2x − 1.
Equating to zero, we get
2x − 1 = 0,
whence 2x = 1,
or x =
1
2
.
That is to say, when x is made = 1
2
, the corresponding value of y
will be either a maximum or a minimum. Accordingly, putting x =
1
2
in the original equation, we get
y = ( 1
2
)
2 −
1
2
,
or y = −
1
4
.
Is this a maximum or a minimum? To test it, try putting x a little
bigger than 1
2
,—say make x = 0.6. Then
y = (0.6)2 − 0.6 = 0.36 − 0.6 = −0.24,
which is higher up than −0.25; showing that y = −0.25 is a minimum.
Plot the curve for yourself, and verify the calculation.

A further exercise in maxima and minima is afforded by the following
example:
The equation to a circle of radius r, having its centre C at the point
whose coordinates are x = a, y = b, as depicted in Fig. 29, is:
(y − b)
2 + (x − a)
2 = r

This may be transformed into
y =

2 + b.
MAXIMA AND MINIMA 101
Now we know beforehand, by mere inspection of the figure, that
when x = a, y will be either at its maximum value, b + r, or else at its
minimum value, b−r. But let us not take advantage of this knowledge;
let us set about finding what value of x will make y a maximum or a
minimum, by the process of differentiating and equating to zero.
dy
dx =
1
2
1
p
r
2 − (x − a)
2
× (2a − 2x),
which reduces to
dy
dx =
a − x
p
r
2 − (x − a)
2
.
Then the condition for y being maximum or minimum is:
a − x
p
r
2 − (x − a)
2
= 0.
Since no value whatever of x will make the denominator infinite,
the only condition to give zero is
x = a.
Inserting this value in the original equation for the circle, we find
y =
√
r
2 + b;
and as the root of r
2
is either +r or −r, we have two resulting values
of y,



y
y
= b + r
= b − r.
CALCULUS MADE EASY 102
The first of these is the maximum, at the top; the second the minimum,
at the bottom.
If the curve is such that there is no place that is a maximum or
minimum, the process of equating to zero will yield an impossible result.
For instance:
Let y = ax3 + bx + c.
Then dy
dx = 3ax2 + b.
Equating this to zero, we get 3ax2 + b = 0,
x
2 =
−b
3a
, and x =
r
−b
3a
, which is impossible.
Therefore y has no maximum nor minimum.
A few more worked examples will enable you to thoroughly master
this most interesting and useful application of the calculus.

There is only one value, hence only one maximum or minimum.
For x = 2, y = 2,
for x = 1.5, y = 2.27,
for x = 2.5, y = 2.27;
it is therefore a minimum. (It is instructive to plot the graph of the
function.)
(4) Find the maxima and minima of the function y =

For x = ±0.5, y = 1.932, so this is a maximum.

We have

for maximum or minimum; or
2x

(2x − 4)2
= 0;
or x
2 − 4x + 5 = 0; which has for solutions
x =

These being imaginary, there is no real value of x for which dy
dx = 0;
hence there is neither maximum nor minimum.

that is, x(2±

5
2
x

2 = 0,
that is for x =

25 . So there are two solutions.
Taking first x = 0. If x = −0.5, y = 0.25 ±
p2 −(.5)5
, and if
x = +0.5, y = 0.25 ±
p2
(.5)5
. On one side y is imaginary; that is,
there is no value of y that can be represented by a graph; the latter is
therefore entirely on the right side of the axis of y (see Fig. 30).
On plotting the graph it will be found that the curve goes to the
origin, as if there were a minimum there; but instead of continuing
beyond, as it should do for a minimum, it retraces its steps (forming
CALCULUS MADE EASY 106
what is called a “cusp”). There is no minimum, therefore, although the
condition for a minimum is satisfied, namely dy
dx = 0. It is necessary
therefore always to check by taking one value on either side.

Now, if we take x =

y = 0.0819; if x = 0.6, y becomes 0.6389 and 0.0811; and if x = 0.7,
y becomes 0.8996 and 0.0804.
This shows that there are two branches of the curve; the upper one
does not pass through a maximum, but the lower one does.
(7) A cylinder whose height is twice the radius of the base is increasing

area is increasing at the rate of 20 square inches per second; at what

CHAPTER XII.
CURVATURE OF CURVES.
Returning to the process of successive differentiation, it may be
asked: Why does anybody want to differentiate twice over? We know
that when the variable quantities are space and time, by differentiating
twice over we get the acceleration of a moving body, and that in the
geometrical interpretation, as applied to curves, dy
dx means the slope of
the curve. But what can d
2
y
dx2 mean in this case? Clearly it means the
rate (per unit of length x) at which the slope is changing—in brief, it
is a measure of the curvature of the slope.
O X
Y
Fig. 31.
O X

Fig. 32.
Suppose a slope constant, as in Fig. 31.
CALCULUS MADE EASY 110
Here, dy
dx is of constant value.
Suppose, however, a case in which, like Fig. 32, the slope itself is
getting greater upwards, then
d

dy
dx
dx , that is, d
2
y
dx2
, will be positive.
If the slope is becoming less as you go to the right (as in Fig. 14,
p. 80), or as in Fig. 33, then, even though the curve may be going
upward, since the change is such as to diminish its slope, its d
2
y
dx2
will
be negative.
O X
Y
Fig. 33.
It is now time to initiate you into another secret—how to tell
whether the result that you get by “equating to zero” is a maximum or
a minimum. The trick is this: After you have differentiated (so as to
get the expression which you equate to zero), you then differentiate a
second time, and look whether the result of the second differentiation
is positive or negative. If d
2
y
dx2
comes out positive, then you know that
the value of y which you got was a minimum; but if d
2
y
dx2
comes out
negative, then the value of y which you got must be a maximum. That’s
CURVATURE OF CURVES 111
the rule.
The reason of it ought to be quite evident. Think of any curve that
has a minimum point in it (like Fig. 15, p. 80), or like Fig. 34, where the
point of minimum y is marked M, and the curve is concave upwards.
To the left of M the slope is downward, that is, negative, and is getting
less negative. To the right of M the slope has become upward, and
is getting more and more upward. Clearly the change of slope as the
M

y min.

Y

M

O X
Y
Fig. 35.
curve passes through M is such that d
2
y
dx2
is positive, for its operation,
as x increases toward the right, is to convert a downward slope into an
upward one.
Similarly, consider any curve that has a maximum point in it (like
Fig. 16, p. 81), or like Fig. 35, where the curve is convex, and the maximum
point is marked M. In this case, as the curve passes through M
from left to right, its upward slope is converted into a downward or
negative slope, so that in this case the “slope of the slope” d
2
y
dx2
is
negative.
Go back now to the examples of the last chapter and verify in this

way the conclusions arrived at as to whether in any particular case
there is a maximum or a minimum. You will find below a few worked
out examples.
(1) Find the maximum or minimum of

The denominator is always positive, so it is sufficient to ascertain
the sign of the numerator.
If we put x = 2.73, the numerator is negative; the maximum, y =
0.183.
If we put x = −0.73, the numerator is positive; the minimum,
y = −0.683.

Partial Fractions.
We have seen that when we differentiate a fraction we have to perform
a rather complicated operation; and, if the fraction is not itself a simple
one, the result is bound to be a complicated expression. If we could
split the fraction into two or more simpler fractions such that their
sum is equivalent to the original fraction, we could then proceed by
differentiating each of these simpler expressions. And the result of
differentiating would be the sum of two (or more) differentials, each one
of which is relatively simple; while the final expression, though of course
it will be the same as that which could be obtained without resorting
to this dodge, is thus obtained with much less effort and appears in a
simplified form.
Let us see how to reach this result. Try first the job of adding
two fractions together to form a resultant fraction. Take, for example,
the two fractions 1
x + 1
and 2
x − 1
. Every schoolboy can add these
together and find their sum to be 3x + 1
x
2 − 1
. And in the same way he can
add together three or more fractions. Now this process can certainly
be reversed: that is to say, that if this last expression were given, it
OTHER USEFUL DODGES 119
is certain that it can somehow be split back again into its original
components or partial fractions. Only we do not know in every case
that may be presented to us how we can so split it. In order to find
this out we shall consider a simple case at first. But it is important
to bear in mind that all which follows applies only to what are called
“proper” algebraic fractions, meaning fractions like the above, which
have the numerator of a lesser degree than the denominator; that is,
those in which the highest index of x is less in the numerator than in
the denominator. If we have to deal with such an expression as x
2 + 2
x
2 − 1
,
we can simplify it by division, since it is equivalent to 1 + 3
x
2 − 1
; and
3
x
2 − 1
is a proper algebraic fraction to which the operation of splitting
into partial fractions can be applied, as explained hereafter.
Case I. If we perform many additions of two or more fractions
the denominators of which contain only terms in x, and no terms in
x
2
, x
3
, or any other powers of x, we always find that the denominator
of the final resulting fraction is the product of the denominators of
the fractions which were added to form the result. It follows that by
factorizing the denominator of this final fraction, we can find every one
of the denominators of the partial fractions of which we are in search.
Suppose we wish to go back from 3x + 1
x
2 − 1
to the components which
we know are 1
x + 1
and 2
x − 1
. If we did not know what those components
were we can still prepare the way by writing:
3x + 1
x
2 − 1
=
3x + 1
(x + 1)(x − 1) =
x + 1
+
x − 1
,
leaving blank the places for the numerators until we know what to put
CALCULUS MADE EASY 120
there. We always may assume the sign between the partial fractions
to be plus, since, if it be minus, we shall simply find the corresponding
numerator to be negative. Now, since the partial fractions are proper
fractions, the numerators are mere numbers without x at all, and we
can call them A, B, C . . . as we please. So, in this case, we have:
3x + 1
x
2 − 1
=
A
x + 1
+
B
x − 1
.
If now we perform the addition of these two partial fractions, we
get
A(x − 1) + B(x + 1)
(x + 1)(x − 1) ; and this must be equal to 3x + 1
(x + 1)(x − 1).
And, as the denominators in these two expressions are the same, the
numerators must be equal, giving us:
3x + 1 = A(x − 1) + B(x + 1).
Now, this is an equation with two unknown quantities, and it would
seem that we need another equation before we can solve them and find
A and B. But there is another way out of this difficulty. The equation
must be true for all values of x; therefore it must be true for such values
of x as will cause x − 1 and x + 1 to become zero, that is for x = 1 and
for x = −1 respectively. If we make x = 1, we get 4 = (A×0)+ (B×2),
so that B = 2; and if we make x = −1, we get −2 = (A×−2)+ (B×0),
so that A = 1. Replacing the A and B of the partial fractions by these
new values, we find them to become 1
x + 1
and 2
x − 1
; and the thing is
done.
As a farther example, let us take the fraction 4x
2 + 2x − 14
x
3 + 3x
2 − x − 3
. The
denominator becomes zero when x is given the value 1; hence x − 1 is
a factor of it, and obviously then the other factor will be x
2 + 4x + 3;
OTHER USEFUL DODGES 121
and this can again be decomposed into (x+ 1)(x+ 3). So we may write
the fraction thus:
4x
2 + 2x − 14
x
3 + 3x
2 − x − 3
=
A
x + 1
+
B
x − 1
+
C
x + 3
,
making three partial factors.
Proceeding as before, we find
4x
2 + 2x − 14 = A(x − 1)(x + 3) + B(x + 1)(x + 3) + C(x + 1)(x − 1).
Now, if we make x = 1, we get:
−8 = (A × 0) + B(2 × 4) + (C × 0); that is, B = −1.
If x = −1, we get:
−12 = A(−2 × 2) + (B × 0) + (C × 0); whence A = 3.
If x = −3, we get:
16 = (A × 0) + (B × 0) + C(−2 × −4); whence C = 2.
So then the partial fractions are:
3
x + 1
−
1
x − 1
+
2
x + 3
,
which is far easier to differentiate with respect to x than the complicated
expression from which it is derived.
CALCULUS MADE EASY 122
Case II. If some of the factors of the denominator contain terms
in x
2
, and are not conveniently put into factors, then the corresponding
numerator may contain a term in x, as well as a simple number; and
hence it becomes necessary to represent this unknown numerator not
by the symbol A but by Ax+B; the rest of the calculation being made
as before.
Try, for instance: −x
2 − 3
(x
2 + 1)(x + 1).
−x
2 − 3
(x
2 + 1)(x + 1) =
Ax + B
x
2 + 1
+
C
x + 1
;
−x
2 − 3 = (Ax + B)(x + 1) + C(x
2 + 1).
Putting x = −1, we get −4 = C × 2; and C = −2;
hence −x
2 − 3 = (Ax + B)(x + 1) − 2x
2 − 2;
and x
2 − 1 = Ax(x + 1) + B(x + 1).
Putting x = 0, we get −1 = B;
hence
x
2 − 1 = Ax(x + 1) − x − 1; or x
2 + x = Ax(x + 1);
and x + 1 = A(x + 1),
so that A = 1, and the partial fractions are:
x − 1
x
2 + 1
−
2
x + 1
.
Take as another example the fraction
x
3 − 2
(x
2 + 1)(x
2 + 2).
OTHER USEFUL DODGES 123
We get
x
3 − 2
(x

x
2 + 2
=
(Ax + B)(x
2 + 2) + (Cx + D)(x
2 + 1)
(x
2 + 1)(x
2 + 2) .
In this case the determination of A, B, C, D is not so easy. It
will be simpler to proceed as follows: Since the given fraction and
the fraction found by adding the partial fractions are equal, and have
identical denominators, the numerators must also be identically the
same. In such a case, and for such algebraical expressions as those with
which we are dealing here, the coefficients of the same powers of x are
equal and of same sign.
Hence, since
x
3 − 2 = (Ax + B)(x
2 + 2) + (Cx + D)(x
2 + 1)
= (A + C)x
3 + (B + D)x
2 + (2A + C)x + 2B + D,
we have 1 = A + C; 0 = B + D (the coefficient of x
2
in the left
expression being zero); 0 = 2A + C; and −2 = 2B + D. Here are
four equations, from which we readily obtain A = −1; B = −2; C = 2;
D = 0; so that the partial fractions are 2(x + 1)
x
2 + 2
−
x + 2
x
2 + 1
. This method
can always be used; but the method shown first will be found the
quickest in the case of factors in x only.
Case III. When, among the factors of the denominator there are
some which are raised to some power, one must allow for the possible
existence of partial fractions having for denominator the several
powers of that factor up to the highest. For instance, in splitting the
CALCULUS MADE EASY 124
fraction 3x
2 − 2x + 1
(x + 1)2
(x − 2) we must allow for the possible existence of a
denominator x + 1 as well as (x + 1)2 and (x − 2).
It maybe thought, however, that, since the numerator of the fraction
the denominator of which is (x + 1)2 may contain terms in x, we must
allow for this in writing Ax + B for its numerator, so that
3x
2 − 2x + 1
(x + 1)2
(x − 2) =
Ax + B
(x + 1)2
+
C
x + 1
+
D
x − 2
.
If, however, we try to find A, B, C and D in this case, we fail, because
we get four unknowns; and we have only three relations connecting
them, yet

(x + 1)2
(x − 2) =
x − 1
(x + 1)2

But if we write

(x + 1)2
(x − 2) =
A
(x + 1)2
+
B
x + 1
+
C
x − 2
,
we get
3x
2 − 2x + 1 = A(x − 2) + B(x + 1)(x − 2) + C(x + 1)2
,
which gives C = 1 for x = 2. Replacing C by its value, transposing,
gathering like terms and dividing by x−2, we get −2x = A+B(x+ 1),
which gives A = −2 for x = −1. Replacing A by its value, we get
2x = −2 + B(x + 1).
Hence B = 2; so that the partial fractions are:

x + 1
−

(x + 1)2

observe that x − 1
(x + 1)2
can itself be split into the two fractions 1

which are the partial fractions obtained.
We see that it is sufficient to allow for one numerical term in each
numerator, and that we always get the ultimate partial fractions.
When there is a power of a factor of x
2
in the denominator, however,
the corresponding numerators must be of the form Ax+B; for example,
3x − 1
(2x
2 − 1)2
(x + 1) =
Ax + B
(2x
2 − 1)2
+
Cx + D
2x

E

,
which gives
3x − 1 = (Ax + B)(x + 1) + (Cx + D)(x + 1)(2x
2 − 1) + E(2x
2 − 1)2
.
For x = −1, this gives E = −4. Replacing, transposing, collecting
like terms, and dividing by x + 1, we get
16x
3 − 16x
2 + 3 = 2Cx3 + 2Dx2 + x(A − C) + (B − D).
Hence 2C = 16 and C = 8; 2D = −16 and D = −8; A − C = 0 or
A − 8 = 0 and A = 8, and finally, B − D = 3 or B = −5. So that we
obtain as the partial fractions:
(8x − 5)

8(x − 1)
2x
2 − 1

It is useful to check the results obtained. The simplest way is to
replace x by a single value, say +1, both in the given expression and in
the partial fractions obtained.
Whenever the denominator contains but a power of a single factor,
a very quick method is as follows:
Taking, for example, 4x + 1
(x + 1)3
, let x + 1 = z; then x = z − 1.

which is really the same result as above split into partial fractions.
But the splitting, if done after differentiating, is more complicated, as
will easily be seen. When we shall deal with the integration of such
expressions, we shall find the splitting into partial fractions a precious
auxiliary (see p. 228).

It follows that, being given a function, if it be easier to differentiate

coefficient of the inverse function gives the differential coefficient

CHAPTER XIV.
ON TRUE COMPOUND INTEREST AND THE LAW
OF ORGANIC GROWTH.
Let there be a quantity growing in such a way that the increment of
its growth, during a given time, shall always be proportional to its own
magnitude. This resembles the process of reckoning interest on money
at some fixed rate; for the bigger the capital, the bigger the amount of
interest on it in a given time.
Now we must distinguish clearly between two cases, in our calculation,
according as the calculation is made by what the arithmetic books
call “simple interest,” or by what they call “compound interest.” For
in the former case the capital remains fixed, while in the latter the
interest is added to the capital, which therefore increases by successive
additions.
(1) At simple interest. Consider a concrete case. Let the capital at
start be £100, and let the rate of interest be 10 per cent. per annum.
Then the increment to the owner of the capital will be £10 every year.
Let him go on drawing his interest every year, and hoard it by putting
it by in a stocking, or locking it up in his safe. Then, if he goes on for
10 years, by the end of that time he will have received 10 increments
CALCULUS MADE EASY 132
of £10 each, or £100, making, with the original £100, a total of £200
in all. His property will have doubled itself in 10 years. If the rate of
interest had been 5 per cent., he would have had to hoard for 20 years
to double his property. If it had been only 2 per cent., he would have
had to hoard for 50 years. It is easy to see that if the value of the yearly
interest is
1
n
of the capital, he must go on hoarding for n years in order
to double his property.
Or, if y be the original capital, and the yearly interest is y
n
, then,
at the end of n years, his property will be
y + n
y
n
= 2y.
(2) At compound interest. As before, let the owner begin with a
capital of £100, earning interest at the rate of 10 per cent. per annum;
but, instead of hoarding the interest, let it be added to the capital
each year, so that the capital grows year by year. Then, at the end
of one year, the capital will have grown to £110; and in the second
year (still at 10%) this will earn £11 interest. He will start the third
year with £121, and the interest on that will be £12. 2s.; so that he
starts the fourth year with £133. 2s., and so on. It is easy to work
it out, and find that at the end of the ten years the total capital will
have grown to £259. 7s. 6d. In fact, we see that at the end of each
year, each pound will have earned 1
10 of a pound, and therefore, if
this is always added on, each year multiplies the capital by 11
10 ; and if
continued for ten years (which will multiply by this factor ten times
over) will multiply the original capital by 2.59374. Let us put this into
symbols. Put y0 for the original capital; 1
n
for the fraction added on at
ON TRUE COMPOUND INTEREST 133
each of the n operations; and yn for the value of the capital at the end
of the n
th operation. Then
yn = y0

1 +
1
n
n
.
But this mode of reckoning compound interest once a year, is really
not quite fair; for even during the first year the £100 ought to have been
growing. At the end of half a year it ought to have been at least £105,
and it certainly would have been fairer had the interest for the second
half of the year been calculated on £105. This would be equivalent to
calling it 5% per half-year; with 20 operations, therefore, at each of

of ten years the capital would have grown to £265. 6s. 7d.; for

But, even so, the process is still not quite fair; for, by the end of
the first month, there will be some interest earned; and a half-yearly
reckoning assumes that the capital remains stationary for six months at
a time. Suppose we divided the year into 10 parts, and reckon a one-percent.

Go even more minutely, and divide the ten years into 10, 000 parts,

, which, as we see, is
greater than 2; and which, as we take n larger and larger, grows closer
and closer to a particular limiting value. However big you make n, the
value of this expression grows nearer and nearer to the figure
2.71828 . . .
a number never to be forgotten.
Let us take geometrical illustrations of these things. In Fig. 36,
OP stands for the original value. OT is the whole time during which
the value is growing. It is divided into 10 periods, in each of which
there is an equal step up. Here dy
dx is a constant; and if each step up
is 1
10 of the original OP, then, by 10 such steps, the height is doubled.
If we had taken 20 steps, each of half the height shown, at the end the
height would still be just doubled. Or n such steps, each of 1
n
of the
original height OP, would suffice to double the height. This is the case
of simple interest. Here is 1 growing till it becomes 2.
In Fig. 37, we have the corresponding illustration of the geometrical
progression. Each of the successive ordinates is to be 1 + 1
n
, that is,
n + 1
n
times as high as its predecessor. The steps up are not equal,

because each step up is now 1

of the ordinate at that part of the curve.
If we had literally 10 steps, with

for the multiplying factor,
the final total would be (1 + 1

10 or 2.594 times the original 1. But if
only we take n sufficiently large (and the corresponding 1

Epsilon. To this mysterious number 2.7182818 etc., the mathemati-
CALCULUS MADE EASY 136
cians have assigned as a symbol the Greek letter  (pronounced epsilon).
All schoolboys know that the Greek letter π (called pi) stands
for 3.141592 etc.; but how many of them know that epsilon means
2.71828? Yet it is an even more important number than π!
What, then, is epsilon?
Suppose we were to let 1 grow at simple interest till it became 2;
then, if at the same nominal rate of interest, and for the same time,
we were to let 1 grow at true compound interest, instead of simple, it
would grow to the value epsilon.
This process of growing proportionately, at every instant, to the
magnitude at that instant, some people call a logarithmic rate of growing.
Unit logarithmic rate of growth is that rate which in unit time will
cause 1 to grow to 2.718281. It might also be called the organic rate
of growing: because it is characteristic of organic growth (in certain
circumstances) that the increment of the organism in a given time is
proportional to the magnitude of the organism itself.
If we take 100 per cent. as the unit of rate, and any fixed period
as the unit of time, then the result of letting 1 grow arithmetically at
unit rate, for unit time, will be 2, while the result of letting 1 grow
logarithmically at unit rate, for the same time, will be 2.71828 . . . .
A little more about Epsilon. We have seen that we require to know
what value is reached by the expression 
1 +

, when n becomes
indefinitely great. Arithmetically, here are tabulated a lot of values
(which anybody can calculate out by the help of an ordinary table of
logarithms) got by assuming n = 2; n = 5; n = 10; and so on, up to

1000 = 2.7169.

10,000 = 2.7181.
It is, however, worth while to find another way of calculating this
immensely important figure.
Accordingly, we will avail ourselves of the binomial theorem, and
expand the expression 

in that well-known way.

Now, if we suppose n to become indefinitely great, say a billion, or
a billion billions, then n − 1, n − 2, and n − 3, etc., will all be sensibly
equal to n; and then the series becomes

This series is called the exponential series.
The great reason why  is regarded of importance is that 
x possesses
a property, not possessed by any other function of x, that when you
differentiate it its value remains unchanged; or, in other words, its
differential coefficient is the same as itself. This can be instantly seen
by differentiating it with respect to x, thus:

which is exactly the same as the original series.
CALCULUS MADE EASY 140
Now we might have gone to work the other way, and said: Go to;
let us find a function of x, such that its differential coefficient is the
same as itself. Or, is there any expression, involving only powers of x,
which is unchanged by differentiation? Accordingly; let us assume as
a general expression that
y = A + Bx + Cx2 + Dx3 + Ex4 + etc.,
(in which the coefficients A, B, C, etc. will have to be determined),
and differentiate it.
dy
dx = B + 2Cx + 3Dx2 + 4Ex3 + etc.
Now, if this new expression is really to be the same as that from
which it was derived, it is clear that A must = B; that C =
B

=
A
1 · 2
;
that D =
C
3
=
A
1 · 2 · 3
; that E =

The law of change is therefore that

If, now, we take A = 1 for the sake of further simplicity, we have
y = 1 +

1 · 2

x

1 · 2 · 3

Differentiating it any number of times will give always the same
series over again.
If, now, we take the particular case of A = 1, and evaluate the
THE LAW OF ORGANIC GROWTH 141
series, we shall get simply
when x = 1, y = 2.718281 etc.; that is, y = ;
when x = 2, y = (2.718281 etc.)2
; that is, y = 
2
;
when x = 3, y = (2.718281 etc.)3
; that is, y = 

and therefore
when x = x, y = (2.718281 etc.)

[Note.—How to read exponentials. For the benefit of those who
have no tutor at hand it may be of use to state that 
x
is read as
“epsilon to the eksth power ;” or some people read it “exponential eks.”
So 
pt is read “epsilon to the pee-teeth-power” or “exponential pee tee.”
Take some similar expressions:—Thus, 
−2
is read “epsilon to the minus
two power” or “exponential minus two.” 
−ax is read “epsilon to the
minus ay-eksth” or “exponential minus ay-eks.”]
Of course it follows that 
y
remains unchanged if differentiated with
respect to y. Also 
ax, which is equal to (
a
)
x
, will, when differentiated
with respect to x, be aax, because a is a constant.
Natural or Naperian Logarithms.
Another reason why  is important is because it was made by Napier,
the inventor of logarithms, the basis of his system. If y is the value of
CALCULUS MADE EASY 142

x
, then x is the logarithm, to the base , of y. Or, if
y = 
x
,
then x = log y.
The two curves plotted in Figs. 38 and 39 represent these equations.

It will be seen that, though the calculations yield different points

the same thing.
THE LAW OF ORGANIC GROWTH 143
As many persons who use ordinary logarithms, which are calculated
to base 10 instead of base , are unfamiliar with the “natural”
logarithms, it may be worth while to say a word about them. The ordinary
rule that adding logarithms gives the logarithm of the product
still holds good; or
log a + log
b = log ab.
Also the rule of powers holds good;
n × log a = log a
n
.
But as 10 is no longer the basis, one cannot multiply by 100 or 1000
by merely adding 2 or 3 to the index. One can change the natural
logarithm to the ordinary logarithm simply by multiplying it by 0.4343;
or
log10 x = 0.4343 × log x,
and conversely, log x = 2.3026 × log10 x.
Exponential and Logarithmic Equations.
Now let us try our hands at differentiating certain expressions that
contain logarithms or exponentials.
Take the equation:
y = log x.
First transform this into

y = x,
whence, since the differential of 
y with regard to y is the original
function unchanged (see p. 139),

and, reverting from the inverse to the original function,

.
Now this is a very curious result. It may be written
d(log x)
dx = x
−1
.
Note that x
−1
is a result that we could never have got by the rule for
differentiating powers. That rule (page 24) is to multiply by the power,
and reduce the power by 1. Thus, differentiating x
3 gave us 3x
2
; and
differentiating x
2 gave 2x
1
. But differentiating x
0 does not give us
x
−1 or 0 × x
−1
, because x
0
is itself = 1, and is a constant. We shall
have to come back to this curious fact that differentiating log x gives
us
1
x
when we reach the chapter on integrating.
Now, try to differentiate
y = log
(x + a),
that is 
y = x + a;
we have d(x + a)
dy = 
y
, since the differential of 
y
remains 
y
.
This gives dx
dy = 
y = x + a;
hence, reverting to the original function (see p. 128), we get
dy
dx =
1
dx
dy
=
1
x + a
.

Next try y = log10 x.
First change to natural logarithms by multiplying by the modulus
0.4343. This gives us
y = 0.4343 log x;
whence dy
dx =
0.4343
x
.
The next thing is not quite so simple. Try this:
y = a
x
.
Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get
log y = x log a,
or x =
log y
log a
=
1
log a
× log y.
Since 1
log a
is a constant, we get

hence, reverting to the original function.

The Logarithmic Curve.
Let us return to the curve which has its successive ordinates in
geometrical progression, such as that represented by the equation y =
bpx
.
We can see, by putting x = 0, that b is the initial height of y.
Then when
x = 1, y = bp; x = 2, y = bp2
; x = 3, y = bp3
, etc.
Also, we see that p is the numerical value of the ratio between the
height of any ordinate and that of the next preceding it. In Fig. 40, we
have taken p as 6
5
; each ordinate being 6
5
as high as the preceding one.

Fig. 41.
If two successive ordinates are related together thus in a constant
ratio, their logarithms will have a constant difference; so that, if we
should plot out a new curve, Fig. 41, with values of log y as ordinates,
it would be a straight line sloping up by equal steps. In fact, it follows
THE LAW OF ORGANIC GROWTH 153
from the equation, that
log y = log
b + x · log p,
whence log y − log
b = x · log p.
Now, since log p is a mere number, and may be written as log p = a,
it follows that
log
y
b
= ax,
and the equation takes the new form
y = bax
.
The Die-away Curve.
If we were to take p as a proper fraction (less than unity), the curve
would obviously tend to sink downwards, as in Fig. 42, where each
successive ordinate is 3
4
of the height of the preceding one.
The equation is still
y = bpx
;
but since p is less than one, log p will be a negative quantity, and may
be written −a; so that p = 
−a
, and now our equation for the curve
takes the form
y = b−ax
.
The importance of this expression is that, in the case where the
independent variable is time, the equation represents the course of a

great many physical processes in which something is gradually dying
away. Thus, the cooling of a hot body is represented (in Newton’s
celebrated “law of cooling”) by the equation
θt = θ0
−at;
where θ0 is the original excess of temperature of a hot body over that
of its surroundings, θt the excess of temperature at the end of time t,
and a is a constant—namely, the constant of decrement, depending on
the amount of surface exposed by the body, and on its coefficients of
conductivity and emissivity, etc.
A similar formula,
Qt = Q0
−at
,
is used to express the charge of an electrified body, originally having a
charge Q0, which is leaking away with a constant of decrement a; which
constant depends in this case on the capacity of the body and on the
resistance of the leakage-path.
Oscillations given to a flexible spring die out after a time; and the
dying-out of the amplitude of the motion may be expressed in a similar
THE LAW OF ORGANIC GROWTH 155
way.
In fact 
−at serves as a die-away factor for all those phenomena in
which the rate of decrease is proportional to the magnitude of that
which is decreasing; or where, in our usual symbols, dy
dt is proportional
at every moment to the value that y has at that moment. For we have
only to inspect the curve, Fig. 42 above, to see that, at every part of it,
the slope dy
dx is proportional to the height y; the curve becoming flatter
as y grows smaller. In symbols, thus
y = b−ax
or log y = log
b − ax log
 = log
b − ax,
and, differentiating, 1
y
dy
dx = −a;
hence dy
dx = b−ax × (−a) = −ay;
or, in words, the slope of the curve is downward, and proportional to y
and to the constant a.
We should have got the same result if we had taken the equation in
the form
y = bpx
;
for then dy
dx = bpx × log p.
But log p = −a;
giving us
dy
dx = y × (−a) = −ay,
as before.

The Time-constant. In the expression for the “die-away factor” 
−at
,
the quantity a is the reciprocal of another quantity known as “the timeconstant,”
which we may denote by the symbol T. Then the die-away
factor will be written 

is that this is the length of time which it takes

The values of 
x and 
−x are continually required in different
branches of physics, and as they are given in very few sets of mathematical
tables, some of the values are tabulated on p. 157 for convenience.
As an example of the use of this table, suppose there is a hot body
cooling, and that at the beginning of the experiment (i.e. when t = 0)
it is 72◦ hotter than the surrounding objects, and if the time-constant
of its cooling is 20 minutes (that is, if it takes 20 minutes for its excess
of temperature to fall to 1

part of 72◦
), then we can calculate to what
it will have fallen in any given time t. For instance, let t be 60 minutes.
Then t
T
= 60 ÷ 20 = 3, and we shall have to find the value of 
−3
,
and then multiply the original 72◦ by this. The table shows that 
−3
is 0.0498. So that at the end of 60 minutes the excess of temperature
will have fallen to 72◦ × 0.0498 = 3.586◦

Further Examples.
(1) The strength of an electric current in a conductor at a time
t secs. after the application of the electromotive force producing it is
given by the expression C =
E
R
n
1 − 
− Rt
L

The time constant is L

.
If E = 10, R = 1, L = 0.01; then when t is very large the term 
− Rt
L
becomes 1, and C =
E
R
= 10; also
L
R
= T = 0.01.
Its value at any time may be written:
C = 10 − 10
− t
0.01 ,
the time-constant being 0.01. This means that it takes 0.01 sec. for the
variable term to fall by 1


− 0
0.01 = 10.
To find the value of the current when t = 0.001 sec., say,
t
T
= 0.1,

−0.1 = 0.9048 (from table).
It follows that, after 0.001 sec., the variable term is 0.9048 × 10 =
9.048, and the actual current is 10 − 9.048 = 0.952.
Similarly, at the end of 0.1 sec.,
t
T
= 10; 
−10 = 0.000045;
the variable term is 10 × 0.000045 = 0.00045, the current being 9.9995.
(2) The intensity I of a beam of light which has passed through a
thickness l cm. of some transparent medium is I = I0
−Kl, where I0 is
the initial intensity of the beam and K is a “constant of absorption.”
THE LAW OF ORGANIC GROWTH 159
This constant is usually found by experiments. If it be found, for
instance, that a beam of light has its intensity diminished by 18% in
passing through 10 cms. of a certain transparent medium, this means
that 82 = 100 × 
−K×10 or 
−10K = 0.82, and from the table one sees
that 10K = 0.20 very nearly; hence K = 0.02.
To find the thickness that will reduce the intensity to half its value,
one must find the value of l which satisfies the equality 50 = 100×
−0.02l
,
or 0.5 = 
−0.02l
. It is found by putting this equation in its logarithmic
form, namely,
log 0.5 = −0.02 × l × log ,
which gives
l =
−0.3010
−0.02 × 0.4343
= 34.7 centimetres nearly.
(3) The quantity Q of a radio-active substance which has not yet undergone
transformation is known to be related to the initial quantity Q0
of the substance by the relation Q = Q0
−λt, where λ is a constant and
t the time in seconds elapsed since the transformation began.
For “Radium A,” if time is expressed in seconds, experiment shows
that λ = 3.85 × 10−3
. Find the time required for transforming half the
substance. (This time is called the “mean life” of the substance.)
We have 0.5 = 
−0.00385t
.
log 0.5 = −0.00385t × log ;
and t = 3 minutes very nearly.

CHAPTER XV.
HOW TO DEAL WITH SINES AND COSINES.
Greek letters being usual to denote angles, we will take as the usual
letter for any variable angle the letter θ (“theta”).
Let us consider the function
y = sin θ.
dθ
θ
O
y
Fig. 43.
What we have to investigate is the value of d(sin θ)
dθ ; or, in other
words, if the angle θ varies, we have to find the relation between the
increment of the sine and the increment of the angle, both increments
being indefinitely small in themselves. Examine Fig. 43, wherein, if the
SINES AND COSINES 163
radius of the circle is unity, the height of y is the sine, and θ is the
angle. Now, if θ is supposed to increase by the addition to it of the
small angle dθ—an element of angle—the height of y, the sine, will be
increased by a small element dy. The new height y +dy will be the sine
of the new angle θ + dθ, or, stating it as an equation,
y + dy = sin(θ + dθ);
and subtracting from this the first equation gives
dy = sin(θ + dθ) − sin θ.
The quantity on the right-hand side is the difference between two
sines, and books on trigonometry tell us how to work this out. For they
tell us that if M and N are two different angles,
sin M − sin N = 2 cos
M + N
2
· sin
M − N
2
.
If, then, we put M = θ + dθ for one angle, and N = θ for the other,
we may write
dy = 2 cos
θ + dθ + θ
2
· sin
θ + dθ − θ
2
,
or, dy = 2 cos(θ +
1
2
dθ) · sin 1
2
dθ.
But if we regard dθ as indefinitely small, then in the limit we may
neglect 1
2
dθ by comparison with θ, and may also take sin 1
2
dθ as being
the same as 1
2
dθ. The equation then becomes:
dy = 2 cos θ ×
1
2
dθ;
dy = cos θ · dθ,
and, finally, dy
dθ = cos θ.

The accompanying curves, Figs. 44 and 45, show, plotted to scale,
the values of y = sin θ, and dy

of θ.

And it follows that
dy
dθ = − sin θ.
Lastly, take the tangent.
Let y = tan θ,
dy = tan(θ + dθ) − tan θ.
Expanding, as shown in books on trigonometry,
tan(θ + dθ) = tan θ + tan dθ
1 − tan θ · tan dθ ;
whence dy =
tan θ + tan dθ
1 − tan θ · tan dθ − tan θ
=
(1 + tan2
θ) tan dθ
1 − tan θ · tan dθ .
Now remember that if dθ is indefinitely diminished, the value
of tan dθ becomes identical with dθ, and tan θ · dθ is negligibly small
CALCULUS MADE EASY 166
compared with 1, so that the expression reduces to
dy =
(1 + tan2
θ) dθ
1
,
so that dy
dθ = 1 + tan2
θ,
or
dy
dθ = sec2
θ.
Collecting these results, we have:
y
dy
dθ
sin θ cos θ
cos θ − sin θ
tan θ sec2

Sometimes, in mechanical and physical questions, as, for example,
in simple harmonic motion and in wave-motions, we have to deal with
angles that increase in proportion to the time. Thus, if T be the time
of one complete period, or movement round the circle, then, since the
angle all round the circle is 2π radians, or 360◦
, the amount of angle
moved through in time t, will be
θ = 2π
t
T
, in radians,
or θ = 360
t
T
, in degrees.
If the frequency, or number of periods per second, be denoted by n,
then n =
1
T
, and we may then write:
θ = 2πnt.
SINES AND COSINES 167
Then we shall have
y = sin 2πnt.
If, now, we wish to know how the sine varies with respect to time,
we must differentiate with respect, not to θ, but to t. For this we must
resort to the artifice explained in Chapter IX., p. 66, and put
dy
dt =
dy
dθ ·
dθ
dt.
Now dθ
dt will obviously be 2πn; so that
dy
dt = cos θ × 2πn
= 2πn · cos 2πnt.
Similarly, it follows that
d(cos 2πnt)
dt = −2πn · sin 2πnt.
Second Differential Coefficient of Sine or Cosine.
We have seen that when sin θ is differentiated with respect to θ it
becomes cos θ; and that when cos θ is differentiated with respect to θ
it becomes − sin θ; or, in symbols,
d
2
(sin θ)
dθ2
= − sin θ.
So we have this curious result that we have found a function such
that if we differentiate it twice over, we get the same thing from which
we started, but with the sign changed from + to −.
CALCULUS MADE EASY 168
The same thing is true for the cosine; for differentiating cos θ gives
us − sin θ, and differentiating − sin θ gives us − cos θ; or thus:
d
2
(cos θ)
dθ2
= − cos θ.
Sines and cosines are the only functions of which the second differential
coefficient is equal (and of opposite sign to) the original function.
Examples.

of a more complex nature.
(1) y = arc sin x.

PARTIAL DIFFERENTIATION.
We sometimes come across quantities that are functions of more than
one independent variable. Thus, we may find a case where y depends
on two other variable quantities, one of which we will call u and the
other v. In symbols
y = f(u, v).
Take the simplest concrete case.
Let y = u × v.
What are we to do? If we were to treat v as a constant, and differentiate
with respect to u, we should get
dyv = v du;
or if we treat u as a constant, and differentiate with respect to v, we
should have:
dyu = u dv.
The little letters here put as subscripts are to show which quantity
has been taken as constant in the operation.
PARTIAL DIFFERENTIATION 173
Another way of indicating that the differentiation has been performed
only partially, that is, has been performed only with respect to
one of the independent variables, is to write the differential coefficients
with Greek deltas, like ∂, instead of little d. In this way
∂y
∂u = v,
∂y
∂v = u.
If we put in these values for v and u respectively, we shall have
dyv =
∂y
∂u du,
dyu =
∂y
∂v dv,



which are partial differentials.
But, if you think of it, you will observe that the total variation of y
depends on both these things at the same time. That is to say, if both
are varying, the real dy ought to be written
dy =
∂y
∂u du +
∂y
∂v dv;
and this is called a

total differential. In some books it is written dy =

Clearly A is maximum when P is maximum.

For a maximum (clearly it will not be a minimum in this case), one

that is, 2xy − 30x + y

CHAPTER XVII.
INTEGRATION.
The great secret has already been revealed that this mysterious symbol
Z
, which is after all only a long S, merely means “the sum of,” or
“the sum of all such quantities as.” It therefore resembles that other
symbol P (the Greek Sigma), which is also a sign of summation. There
is this difference, however, in the practice of mathematical men as to
the use of these signs, that while P is generally used to indicate the
sum of a number of finite quantities, the integral sign Z
is generally
used to indicate the summing up of a vast number of small quantities of
indefinitely minute magnitude, mere elements in fact, that go to make
up the total required. Thus Z
dy = y, and Z
dx = x.
Any one can understand how the whole of anything can be conceived
of as made up of a lot of little bits; and the smaller the bits the more of
them there will be. Thus, a line one inch long may be conceived as made
up of 10 pieces, each 1
10 of an inch long; or of 100 parts, each part being
1
100 of an inch long; or of 1, 000, 000 parts, each of which is 1
1,000,000 of
an inch long; or, pushing the thought to the limits of conceivability, it
may be regarded as made up of an infinite number of elements each of
which is infinitesimally small.
Yes, you will say, but what is the use of thinking of anything that
INTEGRATION 181
way? Why not think of it straight off, as a whole? The simple reason is
that there are a vast number of cases in which one cannot calculate the
bigness of the thing as a whole without reckoning up the sum of a lot
of small parts. The process of “integrating” is to enable us to calculate
totals that otherwise we should be unable to estimate directly.
Let us first take one or two simple cases to familiarize ourselves with
this notion of summing up a lot of separate parts.
Consider the series:
1 + 1
2 +
1
4 +
1
8 +
1
16 +
1
32 +
1
64 + etc.
Here each member of the series is formed by taking it half the value
of the preceding. What is the value of the total if we could go on to
an infinite number of terms? Every schoolboy knows that the answer
is 2. Think of it, if you like, as a line. Begin with one inch; add a half
1 1/2 1/4 1/8
Fig. 46.
inch, add a quarter; add an eighth; and so on. If at any point of the
operation we stop, there will still be a piece wanting to make up the
whole 2 inches; and the piece wanting will always be the same size as
the last piece added. Thus, if after having put together 1, 1
2
, and 1
4
, we
stop, there will be 1
4 wanting. If we go on till we have added 1
64 , there
will still be 1
64 wanting. The remainder needed will always be equal to
the last term added. By an infinite number of operations only should
we reach the actual 2 inches. Practically we should reach it when we
CALCULUS MADE EASY 182
got to pieces so small that they could not be drawn—that would be
after about 10 terms, for the eleventh term is 1
1024 . If we want to go
so far that not even a Whitworth’s measuring machine would detect it,
we should merely have to go to about 20 terms. A microscope would
not show even the 18th term! So the infinite number of operations is no
such dreadful thing after all. The integral is simply the whole lot. But,
as we shall see, there are cases in which the integral calculus enables us
to get at the exact total that there would be as the result of an infinite
number of operations. In such cases the integral calculus gives us a
rapid and easy way of getting at a result that would otherwise require
an interminable lot of elaborate working out. So we had best lose no
time in learning how to integrate.
Slopes of Curves, and the Curves themselves.
Let us make a little preliminary enquiry about the slopes of curves.
For we have seen that differentiating a curve means finding an expression
for its slope (or for its slopes at different points). Can we perform
the reverse process of reconstructing the whole curve if the slope (or
slopes) are prescribed for us?
Go back to case (2) on p. 82. Here we have the simplest of curves,
a sloping line with the equation
y = ax + b.
We know that here b represents the initial height of y when x = 0,
and that a, which is the same as dy
dx, is the “slope” of the line. The line
INTEGRATION 183
b
O X
Y
Fig. 47.
has a constant slope. All along it the elementary triangles
dx
dy
have the same proportion between height and base. Suppose we were
to take the dx’s, and dy’s of finite magnitude, so that 10 dx’s made up
one inch, then there would be ten little triangles like
Now, suppose that we were ordered to reconstruct the “curve,”
starting merely from the information that dy
dx = a. What could we
do? Still taking the little d’s as of finite size, we could draw 10 of them,
all with the same slope, and then put them together, end to end, like
this: And, as the slope is the same for all, they would join to make, as
in Fig. 48, a sloping line sloping with the correct slope dy
dx = a. And
whether we take the dy’s and dx’s as finite or infinitely small, as they
are all alike, clearly y
x
= a, if we reckon y as the total of all the dy’s,
and x as the total of all the dx’s. But whereabouts are we to put this
CALCULUS MADE EASY 184
c
O X
Y
Fig. 48.
sloping line? Are we to start at the origin O, or higher up? As the only
information we have is as to the slope, we are without any instructions
as to the particular height above O; in fact the initial height is undetermined.
The slope will be the same, whatever the initial height. Let
us therefore make a shot at what may be wanted, and start the sloping
line at a height C above O. That is, we have the equation
y = ax + C.
It becomes evident now that in this case the added constant means
the particular value that y has when x = 0.
Now let us take a harder case, that of a line, the slope of which is
not constant, but turns up more and more. Let us assume that the
upward slope gets greater and greater in proportion as x grows. In
INTEGRATION 185
symbols this is:
dy
dx = ax.
Or, to give a concrete case, take a =
1
5
, so that
dy
dx =
1
5
x.
Then we had best begin by calculating a few of the values of the
slope at different values of x, and also draw little diagrams of them.
When x = 0,
dy
dx = 0,
x = 1,
dy
dx = 0.2,
x = 2,
dy
dx = 0.4,
x = 3,
dy
dx = 0.6,
x = 4,
dy
dx = 0.8,
x = 5,
dy
dx = 1.0.
Now try to put the pieces together, setting each so that the middle
of its base is the proper distance to the right, and so that they fit
together at the corners; thus (Fig. 49). The result is, of course, not
a smooth curve: but it is an approximation to one. If we had taken
bits half as long, and twice as numerous, like Fig. 50, we should have a
CALCULUS MADE EASY 186
1 2 3 4 5

better approximation. But for a perfect curve we ought to take each dx
and its corresponding dy infinitesimally small, and infinitely numerous.
1 2 3 4 5
P
O X
Y
Fig. 50.
Then, how much ought the value of any y to be? Clearly, at any
point P of the curve, the value of y will be the sum of all the little dy’s
from 0 up to that level, that is to say, Z
dy = y. And as each dy is
equal to 1
5
x · dx, it follows that the whole y will be equal to the sum of
all such bits as 1
5
x · dx, or, as we should write it, Z
1
5
x · dx.
Now if x had been constant, Z
1
5
x · dx would have been the same
INTEGRATION 187
as 1
5
x
Z
dx, or 1
5
x
2
. But x began by being 0, and increases to the
particular value of x at the point P, so that its average value from 0 to
that point is 1
2
x. Hence Z
1
5
x dx =
1
10x
2
; or y =
1
10x
2
.
But, as in the previous case, this requires the addition of an undetermined
constant C, because we have not been told at what height
above the origin the curve will begin, when x = 0. So we write, as the
equation of the curve drawn in Fig. 51,
y =
1
10x
2 + C.

CHAPTER XVIII.
INTEGRATING AS THE REVERSE OF
DIFFERENTIATING.
Differentiating is the process by which when y is given us (as a
function of x), we can find dy
dx.
Like every other mathematical operation, the process of differentiation
may be reversed; thus, if differentiating y = x
4 gives us
dy
dx = 4x
3
;
if one begins with dy
dx = 4x
3 one would say that reversing the process
would yield y = x
4
. But here comes in a curious point. We should get
dy
dx = 4x
3
if we had begun with any of the following: x
4
, or x
4 + a,
or x
4 + c, or x
4 with any added constant. So it is clear that in working
backwards from dy
dx to y, one must make provision for the possibility
of there being an added constant, the value of which will be undetermined
until ascertained in some other way. So, if differentiating x
n
yields nxn−1
, going backwards from dy
dx = nxn−1 will give us y = x
n+C;
where C stands for the yet undetermined possible constant.
Clearly, in dealing with powers of x, the rule for working backwards
will be: Increase the power by 1, then divide by that increased power,
and add the undetermined constant.
CALCULUS MADE EASY 190
So, in the case where
dy
dx = x
n
,
working backwards, we get
y =
1
n + 1
x
n+1 + C.
If differentiating the equation y = axn gives us
dy
dx = anxn−1
,
it is a matter of common sense that beginning with
dy
dx = anxn−1
,
and reversing the process, will give us
y = axn
.
So, when we are dealing with a multiplying constant, we must simply
put the constant as a multiplier of the result of the integration.
Thus, if dy
dx = 4x
2
, the reverse process gives us y =
4
3
x
3
.
But this is incomplete. For we must remember that if we had started
with
y = axn + C,
where C is any constant quantity whatever, we should equally have
found
dy
dx = anxn−1
.
So, therefore, when we reverse the process we must always remember
to add on this undetermined constant, even if we do not yet know what
its value will be.
HOW TO INTEGRATE 191
This process, the reverse of differentiating, is called integrating; for
it consists in finding the value of the whole quantity y when you are
given only an expression for dy or for dy
dx. Hitherto we have as much as
possible kept dy and dx together as a differential coefficient: henceforth
we shall more often have to separate them.
If we begin with a simple case,
dy
dx = x
2
.
We may write this, if we like, as
dy = x
2
dx.
Now this is a “differential equation” which informs us that an element
of y is equal to the corresponding element of x multiplied by x
2
.
Now, what we want is the integral; therefore, write down with the
proper symbol the instructions to integrate both sides, thus:
Z
dy =
Z
x
2
dx.
[Note as to reading integrals: the above would be read thus:
“Integral dee-wy equals integral eks-squared dee-eks.”]
We haven’t yet integrated: we have only written down instructions
to integrate—if we can. Let us try. Plenty of other fools can do it—why
not we also? The left-hand side is simplicity itself. The sum of all the
bits of y is the same thing as y itself. So we may at once put:
y =
Z
x
2
dx.
CALCULUS MADE EASY 192
But when we come to the right-hand side of the equation we must
remember that what we have got to sum up together is not all the dx’s,
but all such terms as x
2 dx; and this will not be the same as x
2
Z
dx,
because x
2
is not a constant. For some of the dx’s will be multiplied
by big values of x
2
, and some will be multiplied by small values of x
2
,
according to what x happens to be. So we must bethink ourselves as
to what we know about this process of integration being the reverse
of differentiation. Now, our rule for this reversed process—see p. 189
ante—when dealing with x
n
is “increase the power by one, and divide
by the same number as this increased power.” That is to say, x
2 dx will
be changed∗
to 1
3
x
3
. Put this into the equation; but don’t forget to add
the “constant of integration” C at the end. So we get:
y =
1
3
x
3 + C.
You have actually performed the integration. How easy!
Let us try another simple case.
Let dy
dx = ax12
,
where a is any constant multiplier. Well, we found when differentiating
(see p. 27) that any constant factor in the value of y reappeared
∗You may ask, what has become of the little dx at the end? Well, remember
that it was really part of the differential coefficient, and when changed over to the
right-hand side, as in the x
2 dx, serves as a reminder that x is the independent
variable with respect to which the operation is to be effected; and, as the result of
the product being totalled up, the power of x has increased by one. You will soon
become familiar with all this.
HOW TO INTEGRATE 193
unchanged in the value of dy
dx. In the reversed process of integrating, it
will therefore also reappear in the value of y. So we may go to work as
before, thus
dy = ax12
· dx,
Z
dy =
Z
ax12
· dx,
Z
dy = a
Z
x
12 dx,
y = a ×
1

So that is done. How easy!
We begin to realize now that integrating is a process of finding our
way back, as compared with differentiating. If ever, during differentiating,
we have found any particular expression—in this example ax12—we
can find our way back to the y from which it was derived. The contrast
between the two processes may be illustrated by the following remark
due to a well-known teacher. If a stranger were set down in Trafalgar
Square, and told to find his way to Euston Station, he might find the
task hopeless. But if he had previously been personally conducted from
Euston Station to Trafalgar Square, it would be comparatively easy to
him to find his way back to Euston Station.

CALCULUS MADE EASY 194
There is no reason why we should not integrate each term separately:
for, as may be seen on p. 34, we found that when we differentiated the
sum of two separate functions, the differential coefficient was simply the
sum of the two separate differentiations. So, when we work backwards,
integrating, the integration will be simply the sum of the two separate
integrations.

If either of the terms had been a negative quantity, the corresponding
term in the integral would have also been negative. So that differences
are as readily dealt with as sums.
How to deal with Constant Terms.
Suppose there is in the expression to be integrated a constant term—
such as this:
dy
dx = x
n + b.
This is laughably easy. For you have only to remember that when
you differentiated the expression y = ax, the result was dy
dx = a. Hence,
when you work the other way and integrate, the constant reappears

All these are easy enough. Let us try another case.
Let dy
dx = ax−1
.
Proceeding as before, we will write
dy = ax−1
· dx, Z
dy = a
Z
x
−1
dx.
Well, but what is the integral of x
−1 dx?
If you look back amongst the results of differentiating x
2 and x
3
and x
n
, etc., you will find we never got x
−1
from any one of them as
the value of dy
dx. We got 3x
2
from x
3
; we got 2x from x
2
; we got 1
from x
1
(that is, from x itself); but we did not get x
−1
from x
0
, for
two very good reasons. First, x
0
is simply = 1, and is a constant, and
could not have a differential coefficient. Secondly, even if it could be
differentiated, its differential coefficient (got by slavishly following the
usual rule) would be 0 × x
−1
, and that multiplication by zero gives it
zero value! Therefore when we now come to try to integrate x
−1 dx, we
see that it does not come in anywhere in the powers of x that are given
by the rule:
Z
x
n
dx =
1
n + 1
x
n+1
.
It is an exceptional case.
Well; but try again. Look through all the various differentials obtained
from various functions of x, and try to find amongst them x
−1
.
A sufficient search will show that we actually did get dy
dx = x
−1 as the
result of differentiating the function y = log x (see p. 145).
EASIEST INTEGRATIONS 197
Then, of course, since we know that differentiating log x gives
us x
−1
, we know that, by reversing the process, integrating dy = x
−1 dx
will give us y = log x. But we must not forget the constant factor a
that was given, nor must we omit to add the undetermined constant of
integration. This then gives us as the solution to the present problem,
y = a log x + C.
N.B.—Here note this very remarkable fact, that we could not have
integrated in the above case if we had not happened to know the corresponding
differentiation. If no one had found out that differentiating
log x gave x
−1
, we should have been utterly stuck by the problem how
to integrate x
−1 dx. Indeed it should be frankly admitted that this is
one of the curious features of the integral calculus:—that you can’t integrate
anything before the reverse process of differentiating something
else has yielded that expression which you want to integrate. No one,
even to-day, is able to find the general integral of the expression,
dy
dx = a
−x
2
,
because a
−x
2
has never yet been found to result from differentiating
anything else.
Another simple case.
Find Z
(x + 1)(x + 2) dx.
On looking at the function to be integrated, you remark that it
is the product of two different functions of x. You could, you think,
integrate (x+1) dx by itself, or (x+2) dx by itself. Of course you could.
But what to do with a product? None of the differentiations you have
CALCULUS MADE EASY 198
learned have yielded you for the differential coefficient a product like
this. Failing such, the simplest thing is to multiply up the two functions,
and then integrate. This gives us
Z
(x
2 + 3x + 2) dx.
And this is the same as
Z
x
2
dx +
Z
3x dx +
Z
2 dx.
And performing the integrations, we get

On Double and Triple Integrals.
In many cases it is necessary to integrate some expression for two or
more variables contained in it; and in that case the sign of integration
appears more than once. Thus,
Z Z f(x, y,) dx dy
means that some function of the variables x and y has to be integrated
for each. It does not matter in which order they are done. Thus, take

to which of course a constant is to be added. If we had reversed the
order of the operations, the result would have been the same.
In dealing with areas of surfaces and of solids, we have often to
integrate both for length and breadth, and thus have integrals of the
form
Z Z u · dx dy,
where u is some property that depends, at each point, on x and on y.
This would then be called a surface-integral. It indicates that the value
of all such elements as u · dx · dy (that is to say, of the value of u over
a little rectangle dx long and dy broad) has to be summed up over the
whole length and whole breadth.
Similarly in the case of solids, where we deal with three dimensions.
Consider any element of volume, the small cube whose dimensions
are dx dy dz. If the figure of the solid be expressed by the function
f(x, y, z), then the whole solid will have the volume-integral,
volume = Z Z Z f(x, y, z) · dx · dy · dz.
Naturally, such integrations have to be taken between appropriate limits∗
in each dimension; and the integration cannot be performed unless
one knows in what way the boundaries of the surface depend on x, y,
and z. If the limits for x are from x1 to x2, those for y from y1 to y2,
and those for z from z1 to z2, then clearly we have
volume = Z z2

There are of course plenty of complicated and difficult cases; but, in
general, it is quite easy to see the significance of the symbols where they
are intended to indicate that a certain integration has to be performed
over a given surface, or throughout a given solid space.

CHAPTER XIX.
ON FINDING AREAS BY INTEGRATING.
One use of the integral calculus is to enable us to ascertain the values
of areas bounded by curves.
Let us try to get at the subject bit by bit.
A
P
Q
B
M N
y1
y2
x1
x2
O
Y
Fig. 52.
Let AB (Fig. 52) be a curve, the equation to which is known. That
is, y in this curve is some known function of x. Think of a piece of the
curve from the point P to the point Q.
FINDING AREAS BY INTEGRATING 205
Let a perpendicular PM be dropped from P, and another QN from
the point Q. Then call OM = x1 and ON = x2, and the ordinates
PM = y1 and QN = y2. We have thus marked out the area P QNM
that lies beneath the piece P Q. The problem is, how can we calculate
the value of this area?
The secret of solving this problem is to conceive the area as being
divided up into a lot of narrow strips, each of them being of the
width dx. The smaller we take dx, the more of them there will be
between x1 and x2. Now, the whole area is clearly equal to the sum of
the areas of all such strips. Our business will then be to discover an
expression for the area of any one narrow strip, and to integrate it so
as to add together all the strips. Now think of any one of the strips. It
will be like this: being bounded between two vertical sides,
with a flat bottom dx, and with a slightly curved sloping top.
Suppose we take its average height as being y; then, as its
width is dx, its area will be y dx. And seeing that we may take
the width as narrow as we please, if we only take it narrow
enough its average height will be the same as the height at the
middle of it. Now let us call the unknown value of the whole
area S, meaning surface. The area of one strip will be simply a bit of
the whole area, and may therefore be called dS. So we may write
area of 1 strip = dS = y · dx.
If then we add up all the strips, we get
total area S =
Z
dS =
Z
y dx.
CALCULUS MADE EASY 206
So then our finding S depends on whether we can integrate y ·dx for
the particular case, when we know what the value of y is as a function
of x.
For instance, if you were told that for the particular curve in question
y = b+ax2
, no doubt you could put that value into the expression
and say: then I must find Z
(b + ax2
) dx.
That is all very well; but a little thought will show you that something
more must be done. Because the area we are trying to find is not
the area under the whole length of the curve, but only the area limited
on the left by PM, and on the right by QN, it follows that we must
do something to define our area between those ‘limits.’
This introduces us to a new notion, namely that of integrating between
limits. We suppose x to vary, and for the present purpose we do
not require any value of x below x1 (that is OM), nor any value of x
above x2 (that is ON). When an integral is to be thus defined between
two limits, we call the lower of the two values the inferior limit, and the
upper value the superior limit. Any integral so limited we designate as
a definite integral, by way of distinguishing it from a general integral
to which no limits are assigned.
In the symbols which give instructions to integrate, the limits are
marked by putting them at the top and bottom respectively of the sign
of integration. Thus the instruction
Z x=x2
x=x1
y · dx
will be read: find the integral of y · dx between the inferior limit x1 and
the superior limit x2.
FINDING AREAS BY INTEGRATING 207
Sometimes the thing is written more simply
Z x2
x1
y · dx.
Well, but how do you find an integral between limits, when you have
got these instructions?
Look again at Fig. 52 (p. 204). Suppose we could find the area under
the larger piece of curve from A to Q, that is from x = 0 to x = x2,
naming the area AQNO. Then, suppose we could find the area under
the smaller piece from A to P, that is from x = 0 to x = x1, namely
the area APMO. If then we were to subtract the smaller area from
the larger, we should have left as a remainder the area P QNM, which
is what we want. Here we have the clue as to what to do; the definite
integral between the two limits is the difference between the integral
worked out for the superior limit and the integral worked out for the
lower limit.
Let us then go ahead. First, find the general integral thus:
Z
y dx,
and, as y = b + ax2
is the equation to the curve (Fig. 52),
Z
(b + ax2
) dx
is the general integral which we must find.
Doing the integration in question by the rule (p. 193), we get
bx +
a
3
x
3 + C;
and this will be the whole area from 0 up to any value of x that we
may assign.
CALCULUS MADE EASY 208
Therefore, the larger area up to the superior limit x2 will be
bx2 +
a
3
x
3
2 + C;
and the smaller area up to the inferior limit x1 will be
bx1 +
a
3
x
3
1 + C.
Now, subtract the smaller from the larger, and we get for the area S
the value,
area S = b(x2 − x1) + a
3
(x
3
2 − x
3
1
).
This is the answer we wanted. Let us give some numerical values.
Suppose b = 10, a = 0.06, and x2 = 8 and x1 = 6. Then the area S is
equal to
10(8 − 6) + 0.06
3
(83 − 6
3
)
= 20 + 0.02(512 − 216)
= 20 + 0.02 × 296
= 20 + 5.92
= 25.92.
Let us here put down a symbolic way of stating what we have ascertained
about limits:
Z x=x2
x=x1
y dx = y2 − y1,
where y2 is the integrated value of y dx corresponding to x2, and y1 that
corresponding to x1.
FINDING AREAS BY INTEGRATING 209
All integration between limits requires the difference between two
values to be thus found. Also note that, in making the subtraction the
added constant C has disappeared.
Examples.
(1) To familiarize ourselves with the process, let us take a case of
which we know the answer beforehand. Let us find the area of the
triangle (Fig. 53), which has base x = 12 and height y = 4. We know
beforehand, from obvious mensuration, that the answer will come 24.

Now, here we have as the “curve” a sloping line for which the equation
is

Let us satisfy ourselves about this rather surprising dodge of calculation,
by testing it on a simple example. Get some squared paper,

The plot is given in Fig. 54.
Now reckon out the area beneath the curve by counting the little
squares below the line, from x = 0 as far as x = 12 on the right. There
are 18 whole squares and four triangles, each of which has an area equal
to 1 1
2
squares; or, in total, 24 squares. Hence 24 is the numerical value
of the integral of x

dx between the lower limit of x = 0 and the higher
limit of x = 12.
As a further exercise, show that the value of the same integral between
the limits of x = 3 and x = 15 is 36.

N.B.—Notice that in dealing with definite integrals the constant C
always disappears by subtraction.
Let it be noted that this process of subtracting one part from a
larger to find the difference is really a common practice. How do you
find the area of a plane ring (Fig. 56), the outer radius of which is r2
r1
r2
Fig. 56.
and the inner radius is r1? You know from mensuration that the area
of the outer circle is πr2

then you subtract the latter from the former, and find area of ring

); which may be written
π(r2 + r1)(r2 − r1)
= mean circumference of ring × width of ring.

Prove the ordinary mensuration formula, that the area A of a circle
whose radius is R, is equal to πR2
.

Fig. 59.
Consider an elementary zone or annulus of the surface (Fig. 59), of
breadth dr, situated at a distance r from the centre. We may consider
the entire surface as consisting of such narrow zones, and the whole
area A will simply be the integral of all such elementary zones from
centre to margin, that is, integrated from r = 0 to r = R.
We have therefore to find an expression for the elementary area dA
of the narrow zone. Think of it as a strip of breadth dr, and of a length
that is the periphery of the circle of radius r, that is, a length of 2πr.
Then we have, as the area of the narrow zone,
dA = 2πr dr.
Hence the area of the whole circle will be:
A =

dA =

ascertain the length of the base, so as to know up to what limit we are
to integrate. At N the ordinate y has zero value; therefore, we must
look at the equation and see what value of x will make y = 0. Now,
clearly, if x is 0, y will also be 0, the curve passing through the origin O;
but also, if x = 1, y = 0; so that x = 1 gives us the position of the
point N.

[N.B.—It will be a pretty and simple exercise in maxima and minima

Areas in Polar Coordinates.
When the equation of the boundary of an area is given as a function
of the distance r of a point of it from a fixed point O (see Fig. 61) called
the pole, and of the angle which r makes with the positive horizontal

with a small modification. Instead of a strip of area, we consider a
small triangle OAB, the angle at O being dθ, and we find the sum of
all the little triangles making up the required area.
The area of such a small triangle is approximately AB

Volumes by Integration.
What we have done with the area of a little strip of a surface, we
can, of course, just as easily do with the volume of a little strip of a
solid. We can add up all the little strips that make up the total solid,
and find its volume, just as we have added up all the small little bits
that made up an area to find the final area of the figure operated upon.
Examples.
(1) Find the volume of a sphere of radius r.
A thin spherical shell has for volume 4πx2 dx (see Fig. 59, p. 214);

On Quadratic Means.
In certain branches of physics, particularly in the study of alternating
electric currents, it is necessary to be able to calculate the quadratic
mean of a variable quantity. By “quadratic mean” is denoted the square
root of the mean of the squares of all the values between the limits considered.
Other names for the quadratic mean of any quantity are its
“virtual” value, or its “r.m.s.” (meaning root-mean-square) value. The
French term is valeur efficace. If y is the function under consideration,
and the quadratic mean is to be taken between the limits of x = 0 and
x = l; then the quadratic mean is expressed as

DODGES, PITFALLS, AND TRIUMPHS.
Dodges. A great part of the labour of integrating things consists in
licking them into some shape that can be integrated. The books—and
by this is meant the serious books—on the Integral Calculus are full of
plans and methods and dodges and artifices for this kind of work. The
following are a few of them.
Integration by Parts. This name is given to a dodge, the formula for
which is
Z
u dx = ux −
Z
x du + C.
It is useful in some cases that you can’t tackle directly, for it shows
that if in any case Z
x du can be found, then Z
u dx can also be found.
The formula can be deduced as follows. From p. 37, we have,
d(ux) = u dx + x du,
which may be written
u(dx) = d(ux) − x du,
which by direct integration gives the above expression.
DODGES, PITFALLS, AND TRIUMPHS 225
Examples.
(1) Find Z
w · sinw dw.
Write u = w, and for sinw · dw write dx. We shall then have
du = dw, while Z
sinw · dw = − cosw = x.
Putting these into the formula, we get
Z
w · sinw dw = w(− cosw) −
Z
− cosw dw
= −w cosw + sinw + C.

You can try now some exercises by yourself; you will find some at

Substitution. This is the same dodge as explained in Chap. IX.,
p. 66. Let us illustrate its application to integration by a few examples.

Hence the integral is arc tan 

Let x + 1 = u, dx = du;
then the integral becomes Z

Hence one has finally 1

for the value of the given

Formulæ of Reduction are special forms applicable chiefly to binomial
and trigonometrical expressions that have to be integrated, and
have to be reduced into some form of which the integral is known.
Rationalization, and Factorization of Denominator are dodges applicable
in special cases, but they do not admit of any short or general
explanation. Much practice is needed to become familiar with these
preparatory processes.
The following example shows how the process of splitting into partial
fractions, which we learned in Chap. XIII., p. 118, can be made use of
in integration.

Notice that the same integral can be expressed sometimes in more than
one way (which are equivalent to one another).
Pitfalls. A beginner is liable to overlook certain points that a practised
hand would avoid; such as the use of factors that are equivalent to
either zero or infinity, and the occurrence of indeterminate quantities
such as 0
0
. There is no golden rule that will meet every possible case.
Nothing but practice and intelligent care will avail. An example of a
pitfall which had to be circumvented arose in Chap. XVIII., p. 189,
when we came to the problem of integrating x
−1 dx.
Triumphs. By triumphs must be understood the successes with
which the calculus has been applied to the solution of problems otherwise
intractable. Often in the consideration of physical relations one
is able to build up an expression for the law governing the interaction
of the parts or of the forces that govern them, such expression
being naturally in the form of a differential equation, that is an equation
containing differential coefficients with or without other algebraic
quantities. And when such a differential equation has been found, one
can get no further until it has been integrated. Generally it is much
easier to state the appropriate differential equation than to solve it:—
the real trouble begins then only when one wants to integrate, unless
CALCULUS MADE EASY 230
indeed the equation is seen to possess some standard form of which the
integral is known, and then the triumph is easy. The equation which
results from integrating a differential equation is called∗
its “solution”;
and it is quite astonishing how in many cases the solution looks as if it
had no relation to the differential equation of which it is the integrated
form. The solution often seems as different from the original expression
as a butterfly does from the caterpillar that it was. Who would have
supposed that such an innocent thing as
dy
dx =

a
2 − x
2
could blossom out into
y =
1
2a
log
a + x
a − x
+ C?
yet the latter is the solution of the former.
As a last example, let us work out the above together.
By partial fractions,

∗This means that the actual result of solving it is called its “solution.” But many
mathematicians would say, with Professor Forsyth, “every differential equation is
considered as solved when the value of the dependent variable is expressed as a
function of the independent variable by means either of known functions, or of
integrals, whether the integrations in the latter can or cannot be expressed in terms
of functions already known.”

CHAPTER XXI.
FINDING SOME SOLUTIONS.
In this chapter we go to work finding solutions to some important
differential equations, using for this purpose the processes shown in the
preceding chapters.
The beginner, who now knows how easy most of those processes
are in themselves, will here begin to realize that integration is an art.
As in all arts, so in this, facility can be acquired only by diligent and
regular practice. He who would attain that facility must work out
examples, and more examples, and yet more examples, such as are
found abundantly in all the regular treatises on the Calculus. Our
purpose here must be to afford the briefest introduction to serious work.
Example 1. Find the solution of the differential equation
ay + b
dy
dx = 0.
Transposing we have
b
dy
dx = −ay.
FINDING SOLUTIONS 233
Now the mere inspection of this relation tells us that we have got
to do with a case in which dy
dx is proportional to y. If we think of the
curve which will represent y as a function of x, it will be such that its
slope at any point will be proportional to the ordinate at that point,
and will be a negative slope if y is positive. So obviously the curve
will be a die-away curve (p. 153), and the solution will contain 
−x as
a factor. But, without presuming on this bit of sagacity, let us go to
work.
As both y and dy occur in the equation and on opposite sides, we
can do nothing until we get both y and dy to one side, and dx to the
other. To do this, we must split our usually inseparable companions
dy and dx from one another.
dy
y
= −
a
b
dx.
Having done the deed, we now can see that both sides have got into
a shape that is integrable, because we recognize dy
y
, or
1
y
dy, as a differential
that we have met with (p. 143) when differentiating logarithms.
So we may at once write down the instructions to integrate,
Z
dy
y
=
Z
−
a
b
dx;
and doing the two integrations, we have:
log y = −
a
b
x + log C,
where log C is the yet undetermined constant∗ of integration. Then,
∗We may write down any form of constant as the “constant of integration,” and
the form log C is adopted here by preference, because the other terms in this line
of equation are, or are treated as logarithms; and it saves complications afterward
if the added constant be of the same kind.
CALCULUS MADE EASY 234
delogarizing, we get:
y = C− a
b
x
,
which is the solution required. Now, this solution looks quite unlike
the original differential equation from which it was constructed: yet to
an expert mathematician they both convey the same information as to
the way in which y depends on x.
Now, as to the C, its meaning depends on the initial value of y. For
if we put x = 0 in order to see what value y then has, we find that this
makes y = C−0
; and as 
−0 = 1 we see that C is nothing else than the
particular value∗ of y at starting. This we may call y0, and so write the
solution as
y = y0
− a
b
x
.
Example 2.
Let us take as an example to solve
ay + b
dy
dx = g,
where g is a constant. Again, inspecting the equation will suggest,
(1) that somehow or other 
x will come into the solution, and (2) that
if at any part of the curve y becomes either a maximum or a minimum,
so that dy
dx = 0, then y will have the value = g
a
. But let us go to work
as before, separating the differentials and trying to transform the thing
∗Compare what was said about the “constant of integration,” with reference to
Fig. 48 on p. 184, and Fig. 51 on p. 187.

dy
dx =

;

Now we have done our best to get nothing but y and dy on one
side, and nothing but dx on the other. But is the result on the left side
integrable?
It is of the same form as the result on p. 145; so, writing the instructions
to integrate, we have:

If the condition is laid down that y = 0 when x = 0 we can find C;
for then the exponential becomes = 1; and we have

Putting in this value, the solution becomes

But further, if x grows indefinitely, y will grow to a maximum; for
when x = ∞, the exponential = 0, giving ymax. =

we get finally
y = ymax.(1 − 

This result is also of importance in physical science.

The last term is obviously a term which will die out as t increases,
and may be omitted. The trouble now comes in to find the integral
that appears as a factor. To tackle this we resort to the device (see
p. 224) of integration by parts, the general formula for which is Z

The last integral is still irreducible. To evade the difficulty, repeat
the integration by parts of the left side, but treating it in the reverse
way by writing:

in [b], we may eliminate it, by multiplying [b] by 2πnb

[c] by a
2πnb, and adding them.

This is indeed none other than the equation of an alternating electric
current, where g represents the amplitude of the electromotive force,
n the frequency, a the resistance, b the coefficient of self-induction of
the circuit, and φ is an angle of lag.
Example 4.
Suppose that M dx + N dy = 0.
We could integrate this expression directly, if M were a function of x
only, and N a function of y only; but, if both M and N are functions
that depend on both x and y, how are we to integrate it? Is it itself
an exact differential? That is: have M and N each been formed by
CALCULUS MADE EASY 240
partial differentiation from some common function U, or not? If they
have, then



∂U
∂x = M,
∂U
∂y = N.
And if such a common function exists, then
∂U
∂x dx +
∂U
∂y dy
is an exact differential (compare p. 172).
Now the test of the matter is this. If the expression is an exact
differential, it must be true that
dM
dy =
dN
dx ;
for then d(dU)
dx dy =
d(dU)
dy dx ,
which is necessarily true.
Take as an illustration the equation
(1 + 3xy) dx + x
2
dy = 0.
Is this an exact differential or not? Apply the test.



d(1 + 3xy)
dy = 3x,
d(x
2
)
dx = 2x,
which do not agree. Therefore, it is not an exact differential, and the
two functions 1 + 3xy and x
2 have not come from a common original
function.
FINDING SOLUTIONS 241
It is possible in such cases to discover, however, an integrating factor,
that is to say, a factor such that if both are multiplied by this factor,
the expression will become an exact differential. There is no one rule
for discovering such an integrating factor; but experience will usually
suggest one. In the present instance 2x will act as such. Multiplying
by 2x, we get
(2x + 6x
2
y) dx + 2x
3
dy = 0.
Now apply the test to this.



d(2x + 6x
2
y)
dy = 6x
2

d(2x

dx = 6x

which agrees. Hence this is an exact differential, and may be integrated.

In this case we have a differential equation of the second degree, in
which y appears in the form of a second differential coefficient, as well
as in person.
Transposing, we have d

CALCULUS MADE EASY 242
It appears from this that we have to do with a function such that its
second differential coefficient is proportional to itself, but with reversed
sign. In Chapter XV. we found that there was such a function—namely,
the sine (or the cosine also) which possessed this property. So, without
further ado, we may infer that the solution will be of the form y =
A sin(pt + q). However, let us go to work.
Multiply both sides of the original equation by 2dy

But it can be shown that (see p. 168)

whence, passing from angles to sines,
arc sin

where C1 is a constant angle that comes in by integration.
Or, preferably, this may be written
y = A sin nt + B cos nt, which is the solution.

Here we have obviously to deal with a function y which is such

function we know that has this property is the exponential function
(see p. 139), and we may be certain therefore that the solution of the
equation will be of that form.

Or, the solution, which at first sight does not look as if it had anything
to do with the original equation, shows that y consists of two terms,
one of which grows logarithmically as x increases, and of a second term
which dies away as x increases.
Example 7.
Let b

dy
dt + gy = 0.
Examination of this expression will show that, if b = 0, it has the
form of Example 1, the solution of which was a negative exponential.
On the other hand, if a = 0, its form becomes the same as that of
Example 6, the solution of which is the sum of a positive and a negative
exponential. It is therefore not very surprising to find that the solution
of the present example is
y = (

It was seen (p. 174) that this equation was derived from the original
y = F(x + at) + f(x − at),
where F and f were any arbitrary functions of t.
Another way of dealing with it is to transform it by a change of
variables into
d
2
y
du · dv = 0,
where u = x + at, and v = x − at, leading to the same general solution.
If we consider a case in which F vanishes, then we have simply
y = f(x − at);
and this merely states that, at the time t = 0, y is a particular function
of x, and may be looked upon as denoting that the curve of the
relation of y to x has a particular shape. Then any change in the value
of t is equivalent simply to an alteration in the origin from which x is
reckoned. That is to say, it indicates that, the form of the function
being conserved, it is propagated along the x direction with a uniform
velocity a; so that whatever the value of the ordinate y at any particular
time t0 at any particular point x0, the same value of y will
appear at the subsequent time t1 at a point further along, the abscissa
of which is x0+a(t1−t0). In this case the simplified equation represents
the propagation of a wave (of any form) at a uniform speed along the
x direction.

You have now been personally conducted over the frontiers into the
enchanted land. And in order that you may have a handy reference
to the principal results, the author, in bidding you farewell, begs to
present you with a passport in the shape of a convenient collection of
standard forms (see pp. 249–251). In the middle column are set down
a number of the functions which most commonly occur. The results of
differentiating them are set down on the left; the results of integrating
them are set down on the right. May you find them useful!
EPILOGUE AND APOLOGUE.
It may be confidently assumed that when this tractate “Calculus made
Easy” falls into the hands of the professional mathematicians, they will
(if not too lazy) rise up as one man, and damn it as being a thoroughly
bad book. Of that there can be, from their point of view, no possible
manner of doubt whatever. It commits several most grievous and
deplorable errors.
First, it shows how ridiculously easy most of the operations of the
calculus really are.
Secondly, it gives away so many trade secrets. By showing you that
what one fool can do, other fools can do also, it lets you see that these
mathematical swells, who pride themselves on having mastered such an
awfully difficult subject as the calculus, have no such great reason to
be puffed up. They like you to think how terribly difficult it is, and
don’t want that superstition to be rudely dissipated.
Thirdly, among the dreadful things they will say about “So Easy”
is this: that there is an utter failure on the part of the author to
demonstrate with rigid and satisfactory completeness the validity of
sundry methods which he has presented in simple fashion, and has
even dared to use in solving problems! But why should he not? You
don’t forbid the use of a watch to every person who does not know how
CALCULUS MADE EASY 248
to make one? You don’t object to the musician playing on a violin that
he has not himself constructed. You don’t teach the rules of syntax to
children until they have already become fluent in the use of speech. It
would be equally absurd to require general rigid demonstrations to be
expounded to beginners in the calculus.
One other thing will the professed mathematicians say about this
thoroughly bad and vicious book: that the reason why it is so easy is
because the author has left out all the things that are really difficult.
And the ghastly fact about this accusation is that—it is true! That
is, indeed, why the book has been written—written for the legion of
innocents who have hitherto been deterred from acquiring the elements
of the calculus by the stupid way in which its teaching is almost always
presented. Any subject can be made repulsive by presenting it
bristling with difficulties. The aim of this book is to enable beginners
to learn its language, to acquire familiarity with its endearing simplicities,
and to grasp its powerful methods of solving problems, without
being compelled to toil through the intricate out-of-the-way (and
mostly irrelevant) mathematical gymnastics so dear to the unpractical
mathematician.
There are amongst young engineers a number on whose ears the
adage that what one fool can do, another can, may fall with a familiar
sound. They are earnestly requested not to give the author away, nor
to tell the mathematicians what a fool he really is.

is more readily obtained if for sin2 x we write
1 − cos 2x
2
.
For 2 sin x sin 3x we write cos 2x − cos 4x; and, for sin2
3x,
1 − cos 6x

Making these substitutions, and integrating, we get (see p. 198)

You had better differentiate now the answer and work back to
the given expression as a check.
Every earnest student is exhorted to manufacture more examples
for himself at every stage, so as to test his powers. When integrating
he can always test his answer by differentiating it, to see whether he
gets back the expression from which he started.
There are lots of books which give examples for practice. It will suf-
fice here to name two: R. G. Blaine’s The Calculus and its Applications,
and F. M. Saxelby’s A Course in Practical Mathematics.

1.F.
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
LICENSE
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ’AS-IS’, WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
LICENSE
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
LICENSE
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
www.gutenberg.org
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
